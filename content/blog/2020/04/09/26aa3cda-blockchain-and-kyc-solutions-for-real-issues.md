intro:
    - 'As many of us around the world continue to self-isolate in the current climate, the Blockpass team is ensuring safe working practices whilst continuing to develop our products and put out blogs and articles. In the newsletter this week we highlight two recent posts. The first of these focuses on how improving KYC is necessary for industries, particularly the hospitality industry. The second of the articles examines how reusable KYC can be employed to assist in remote working, online meetings and other situations that are becoming commonplace during the current pandemic. Highlighting a post from last year, we also discuss how blockchain is changing the fundraising scene. Finally, for our 5 minutes With interview this week we sit down for a chat with Will Abramson, a PhD Candidate who works at the Blockpass Identity Lab in Edinburgh Napier University. We hope you continue to stay safe and practice social distancing and self-isolation as we all work to flatten the curve of the coronavirus and reduce the damage it does to society.'

The hospitality industry is no different. From travel to accommodation to car rentals to tourist attractions, there is a need to establish trust in the customer being transacted with.\r\n\r\nIn our latest article, we examine the pain points and inefficiencies in the hospitality industry and how a robust, reusable KYC option such as Blockpass provides could be used to improve customer satisfaction, reduce time and costs, and open up new avenues of business not otherwise possible. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/04/08/kyc-for-hospitality/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website&amp;utm_source=sendgrid\">Click here</a> to read about KYC for hospitality.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6607\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-of-Global-Internet-Pressure-1024x608.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"608\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Building Trust With Remote KYC</strong>\r\nAs the world begins to change in response to the current coronavirus pandemic, the ways in which people interact and do business is evolving, moving towards options that have previously been taken up mostly by startups and small businesses. Working remotely has many advantages, but they have only been embraced en-masse recently.\r\n\r\nWhilst the technology has been around for a while, the potential of remote meetings, conferences, working and business has not yet been fully realised. In order to embrace it to its full potential, there needs to be a method of verifying the person or people you are interacting with - especially if you haven't met them before. This possibility is exactly what Blockpass can provide and is the subject of one of our recent articles. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/04/08/building-trust-through-reusable-kyc-in-the-covid-19-remote-world/?utm_source=sendgrid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website\">Click here</a> to read Building Trust Through Reusable KYC in the COVID-19 Remote World.\r\n\r\n<strong>Current Offers Available to PASS Club Members</strong>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net/ce0314754db75de4/6ef14fc3-6a43-4333-965a-80c225eca6d3/393x57.png\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>J Rotbart &amp; Co.</strong>\r\nOur latest partners, J.

Initially, options for crowdfunding using online came into prominence with sites like GoFundMe and Kickstarter raising funds for thousands of projects.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of blockchain technology, crowdfunding options expanded once again, this time with some different possibilities thanks to the properties of blockchain. This was the topic of discussion in an article we published last year, where we explored both traditional and blockchain options and the uses they have. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/07/26/traditional-fundraising-vs-blockchain-based-fundraising/?utm_source=sendgrid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website\">Click here</a> to read Traditional Fundraising vs Blockchain-based Fundraising.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4852\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kyc-connect-now.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" />\r\n<strong>KYC Connect</strong>\r\nWe're constantly working to improve the functionality and usability of our flagship product, KYC Connect.
