    - "&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.liquidstar.io/\">Liquidstar</a> has developed a Decentralized Autonomous Utility (DAU) management system utilizing Waypoints, container-housed charging stations, that deploy smart batteries for off-grid electricity provision. From the source-agnostic Waypoints, service providers branded as ‘Power Rangers’ manage the rental and deployment of blockchain-enabled batteries to shared mobility and delivery services, homes and offices. Power Rangers are local businesses or entrepreneurs who recharge, deliver and pick up batteries, as well as handle payment administration.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass' digital identity SaaS, <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC Connect<sup>TM</sup></a>, is a core element of Liquidstar’s DAU management stack, providing digital identity profiles for members of the DAU ecosystem. The partnership in the energy sector is a testament to Blockpass' ability to provide <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/10/21/understanding-aml-compliance/\">AML</a> and digital identity solutions to a range of businesses and organizations that need digital verification of trust in an increasingly remote world of COVID-19. Through the Blockpass identity app, end-users have control of their identity, easily create a verified portable identity and reuse it to onboard with any service instantly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Blockpass plays a critical role in Liquidstar, enabling the first physical world implementation of end to end Human+Company+Device identity to power Liquidstar’s Decentralized Autonomous Utility platform, ” noted Conor Colwell, Co-Founder of Liquidstar.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass CEO and Co-Founder Adam Vaziri added, “We are excited about being involved in enabling Liquidstar’s decentralized utility management platform to verify the identities of off-grid ecosystem participants. In an increasingly remote world, there is a strong need to establish trust via reusable and verifiable digital identity.’</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Blockpass and Liquidstar are working with Vista Advisory Partners, Feed the Streets Lagos, Afara Group, Ample and GCIF to provide masks, food, water, and sustainably generated power to those who need it the most. Funds, which can be donated via a project </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/f5dj45-lagos-covid19-relief-food-water-amp-energy-access?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product&amp;utm_campaign=p_email%2B4803-donation-alert-v5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, will also go towards inventory management, transportation of those goods, proper protection for those delivering the goods, and platform costs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidstar also starts a funding round April 25th through equity crowdfunding platform Birchal, and is accepting expressions of interests on its </span><a href=\"https://www.birchal.com/company/liquidstar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fundraising page</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>About Liquidstar</strong>\r\n\r\nLiquidstar offers a new category of energy distribution, utilizing Waypoint charge stations to deploy smart batteries for beyond-the-grid electrical power distribution.
