text: "<b>Where are you from and where do you live now?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally I come from Vinh Long (a western province of Vietnam), but now I live in Ho Chi Minh City - the place where people from all over come to live and work.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your work background and how did you first get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I graduated, I worked for an outsourcing company so I was involved in many projects and experienced a lot of different technologies. Initially I worked in web development, then the company had a new project for a mobile application. At that time, there were no team members trained to work on mobile app development, so I volunteered and from there I followed the mobile programming segment. </span>Coming to Blockpass was also a turn of luck for me. I happened to see the company recruiting and applied for the position and got the job! It’s been a great opportunity to be part of the team here as I have found what I want for my work: my colleagues, my boss, the working environment - that's what kept me so attached to Blockpass for nearly 3 years.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass and what does a typical day look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Blockpass, I am in charge of developing mobile applications. We divide work for each sprint (2 weeks per sprint), then I will plan my own work to ensure the completion of the schedule. Every day I will work through what we have already planned ahead. If there are any difficulties, the team leaders and managers are ready to support me to finish the job.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is something you’ve been proud of whilst working at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Blockpass, I'm proud to be working with colleagues, team leaders and managers that are very good at what they do, as well as being so friendly and sociable.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you think blockchain or crypto’s biggest potential is?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the era of information technology development, the security of information is essential and this is one of my primary concerns. Besides this, information transparency is also a key trend for development. In the future, I believe the banking and finance industry will apply blockchain technology to hinder attacks and improve security and privacy for users.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next 5 years, I think it is likely that the United States will continue to lead development in a lot of industry and technology, but besides that, other developed countries are also investing heavily to develop industries that compete with the US. To me, it doesn't matter who is at the top of the list; it is important that these countries always create good things to serve humanity.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Which hobby or activity are you particularly enjoying at the moment and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favourite activity right now is playing soccer, because when I was little I couldn't play soccer. I only recently started playing. I’m a beginner whilst my teammates play very well. I want to improve to their level so I am practising more to improve my skills. I like soccer because it brings health, toughness and teamwork. It has many challenges and needs perseverance and practice to improve.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend a day with anyone, real or fictional, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a worker living away from home so when I have one, two or three days off, I will spend it all with my family. I always think that I don’t get to spend as much time as I’d like with my parents and grandparents so each year, when I have a holiday, I spend my time returning home to visit my parents and grandparents instead of planning an outing.</span>"
