    - 'As a form of payment, remittance usually refers to money being sent back home by someone who has moved abroad to find work, though it can also refer to businesses sending money to remote suppliers, partners or workers. In this, it both supports people who otherwise would struggle to make ends meet, and helps businesses access a wide and varied pool of talent, resources and specialties. '

As increasing numbers of people are moving and working abroad and sending money home, the amount of value transferred in remittance was expected to continue to rise this year; however, unsurprisingly, with the global issues caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, these payment channels have suffered and will likely take time to recover. Unfortunately, the people most affected by this will be some of the ones least able to afford it.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different methods can be used to transfer money across borders, including cash, cheque, electronic transfer, mobile payments and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. Each one has its </span><a href=\"https://www.knomad.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/World%20Bank%20Board%20Briefing%20Paper-LEVERAGING%20ECONOMIC%20MIGRATION%20FOR%20DEVELOPMENT_0.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits and drawbacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in terms of speed, cost and security.\_ However, as remittance involves sending payments abroad, methods used also need to adhere to <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/10/21/understanding-aml-compliance/\">AML</a> regulations, and potentially other regulations that come into play, particularly around data protection. This can present a specific issue when different jurisdictions are involved as many countries around the world can have not only different regulatory requirements, but also different identity documentation standards, languages and digital capabilities.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complying with the relevant regulatory requirements are necessary to avoid misuse of remittance channels by criminals to commit fraud, fund terrorism and similar illicit activities, but in doing so it can make it more costly and difficult to send such payments overseas. The right kind of identity verification and efficient <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/10/21/understanding-aml-compliance/\">AML</a>\_checks can ensure that the vital services being provided that so many rely on can take place as quickly, seamlessly and at as little cost, as possible.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Blockpass, our goal is to provide the most user-friendly, cost-effective and flexible identity management solution that can be used with a wide range of merchants and service providers, enabling a plethora of options and opportunities for users.
