    - "<b>Where are you from and where do you live now?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m from Vietnam and I’m currently living in Ho Chi Minh City</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your work background and how did you first get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I graduated as an IT engineer in Vietnam with a major in computer networking. After graduation I decided to change my career path to Quality Assurance. Before I joined Blockpass, I worked in Quality Assurance at various software companies where I built up the working and testing processes for the Quality Assurance team and tested many software projects. I joined the Blockpass team as soon as Blockpass started deploying.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass and what does a typical day look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My responsibility in the Blockpass team is to check the quality of our products.I must ensure that our products are the best they can be for customer use. At the beginning of every day, I check customers' emails in case they report bugs. After that, I will continue to test the latest version of the products and software that we will next be releasing to customers.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is something you’ve been proud of whilst working at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being part of the team, I am proud that Blockpass is the best KYC product. It can adapt to almost any customer request and I’m always proud to see the good feedback we receive from our clients about our products.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you think blockchain or crypto’s biggest potential is?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the most significant potential of blockchain is ensuring everything is secured and trusted. Without a solution like this, a hacker can use the personal data such as name/DOB/phone number/passport information ...etc to cheat or make a fake identity, and verifying identity documents from country to country is not easy to do and takes a lot of time. We can use encrypted data on the blockchain to register with any organization or company that needs to use the data of the user without fear of revealing personal information.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we will see the KYC system evolve and used around the world to replace transactions that need to disclose personal data. Users can feel comfortable sharing personal information when it is encrypted.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Which hobby or activity are you particularly enjoying at the moment and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every weekend my family and I often walk in the park to exercise. When we have free time,\_ I’d like to travel to many places to discover new things.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend a day with anyone, real or fictional, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I spent almost all my time working during the week, I would spend a day walking, playing and cooking with my family. I often talk to my wife about work difficulties and how to overcome them. Besides that, if I had the chance, I would talk with Hercules, who was the mythical strongest person in the world, to find a way to improve my strength!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
