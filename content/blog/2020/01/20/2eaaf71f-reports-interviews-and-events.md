intro: 'We have some exciting news to bring you this week from a number of areas.'
text: "Firstly, Blockpass is honoured to have been featured in a comprehensive report from a well-renowned market research company. Beyond this, we highlight our AdPASS campaigns which continue to promote growth of the ecosystem and opportunities for Blockpass users. We take a look at a recent interview with Legacy Trust in the first of an extended series of content which will be coming for Blockpass members. Our next event, Security Tokens Realised 2020, is highlighted, and we hope many of you can make it there to see us. We also showcase our latest article, which examines the process of KYC and how this might impact on a future of digital economies and smart devices. Finally, we have our KYC Connect section and our 5 Minutes With interview, which this week focuses on Bianca Guimaraes-Chadwick, a Lawyer who works as an essential part of the Blockpass legal team. We hope you enjoy and that we see you soon!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3677 size-large\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/KYC-Video-e1579536704909-1024x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Blockpass Recognised in Research Report</strong>\r\nIn tacit acknowledgement of the promise and potential of the work we do here at Blockpass, we were delighted to see Blockpass feature in the recent Forrester report on digital identity: “New Tech: Decentralized Digital Identity (DDID)”.\r\n\r\nThe independent report first contacted Blockpass about inclusion in June of last year. We are committed to continuing to research and develop in the field of decentralised digital identity to maintain our place at the head of innovation. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/17/blockpass-featured-in-forrester-research-report/\">Click here</a> to read more and to find a link to the report which highlights the rapid growth of the DDID market and ecosystem.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4956\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/adpass-banner-1024x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nTwo of the developments of the past twelve months we're most proud of is AdPASS and the Blockpass Marketplace, which provides a means for Blockpass users to find new and exclusive deals offered specifically for them by merchants looking for forward-thinking and technologically-savvy users and investors.

Covering a variety of interests, topics will range from looking into aspects of technology and regulations, to discussions with our partners and colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn the first video to be released, Blockpass CEO Adam Vaziri sits down to talk with Vincent Chok, CEO of Legacy Trust, a provider of trusted custody for both cryptocurrency and traditional fiat assets. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/15/pass-club-presents-interview-with-vincent-chok-ceo-of-legacy-trust/\">Click here</a> to see the interview and to find out more about Legacy Trust.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4167 size-large\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chuttersnap-179223-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Blockpass - Best in class KYC Solution in Blockchain UA\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Security Tokens Realised 2020</strong>\r\nAt the beginning of February, a number of members of the Blockpass team will be in London for Security Tokens Realised 2020.

The process itself has various stages and options which depend on the particular services being offered, the details of individuals involved, or potential risk.\r\n\r\nToday, human and business identities are the main focus for these regulations, but as objects and smart devices become a part of the digital economy and financial services system, the amount of identities that will need to be vetted will rapidly grow. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/19/the-process-of-kyc-and-its-future-in-an-evolving-world\">Click here</a> to read our latest article exploring the stages of KYC and the issues that will be faced in a connected future.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3925 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kyc-connect-now.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>KYC Connect</strong>\r\nWe're constantly working to improve the functionality and usability of our flagship product, KYC Connect.
