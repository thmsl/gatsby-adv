intro: 'In the newsletter this week we have a number of news items to bring you up to date with what''s happening at Blockpass.'
text: "Continuing on from last week, Blockpass has featured in two articles online in the past seven days - see below to find out which! We also have our own recent webinar to highlight, with a number of others on the way that will be announced soon. Our AdPASS section showcases the exclusive offers and opportunities currently open to Blockpass users to enjoy and our latest article focuses on the importance of digital identity for a specific industry - the gambling industry. We also have a reminder for the upcoming Security Tokens Realised event where we hope to see many of you, and our 5 Minutes With interview which this week features HR Executive Cynthia Yiu. We hope you enjoy and those of you that celebrate it had a very happy Chinese New Year!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4441\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ogimage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Blockpass Features in Online Articles</strong>\r\nOver the past week, Blockpass has featured in a couple of articles online. Top 10 Website Hosting reviewed Blockpass' features, uses, function and costs. Elevate Ventures and Advisory included Blockpass in a piece titled \"Why do we need a decentralized digital ID standard?\".\r\n\r\nIn both instances Hans Lombardo, Blockpass' CMO, shared his knowledge and insight from working in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and his work as part of Blockpass. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/25/blockpass-features-in-online-articles/\">Click here</a> for an overview of the articles and links to both the Top 10 Website Hosting and Elevate Ventures and Advisory articles.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4950\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PASS-CLUB-1024x569.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"569\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>The First of the Webinars</strong>\r\nAs the year progresses, Blockpass will be releasing new and exclusive content in a range of media, some of which will be video-based. Covering a variety of interests, topics will range from looking into aspects of technology and regulations, to discussions with our partners and colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn the first webinar to be released, Blockpass CEO Adam Vaziri sits down to talk with Vincent Chok, CEO of Legacy Trust, a provider of trusted custody for both cryptocurrency and traditional fiat assets. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/15/pass-club-presents-interview-with-vincent-chok-ceo-of-legacy-trust/\">Click here</a> to see the interview and to find out more about Legacy Trust.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4956\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/adpass-banner-1024x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" />\r\n\r\nWe are constantly working to enable new deals and offers that encourage the growth and use of the Blockpass Mobile App for users, which provides an increasing community of interested potential customers for businesses, driving the expansion of our ecosystem.

Dealing with large amounts of money moving between relatively anonymous individuals, and the potential of online gambling opening up cross-border interactions, it is a huge industry and an attractive one for criminals.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it isn't hard to see why the gambling industry has compliance requirements and there are hefty fines for those that fail to live up to the standards. But even without the regulatory requirements there are uses for identity verification in the space. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/01/24/why-the-gaming-industry-needs-identity-verification/\">Click here</a> to read the article in full and find out about the reasons and benefits of identity verification in gambling.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3966\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/News_Financial_Libra-ation-1024x870.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"870\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>Blockpass in London</strong>\r\nNext week, many of the Blockpass team will be at Security Tokens Realised 2020. Held at the the De Vere Grand Connaught Rooms in London, the event will cover topics including digitalising capital markets, innovation investment and STOs.\r\n\r\nBlockpass are Gold sponsors of the event and we hope to see you there if you are able to make it to talk about our work, regulations, blockchain technology or anything else you have an interest in! <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/events/security-tokens-realised-2020/\">Click here</a> to read about Security Tokens Realised 2020 or register for the event.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4746\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/600x315-3.jpg\" alt=\"AML, Compliance, Blockpass, Customer Onboarding, Digital identity, identity management, solution Identity, Verification, Know your customer, KYC, regtech, security tokens, sto, blockchain, verification, document checks, id checks, fast kyc, best kyc, semaless kyc, PASS, crypto, cryptocurrency, Adpass, Ad PASS, PASS tokens, KYC Now\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>KYC Connect</strong>\r\nWe're constantly working to improve the functionality and usability of our flagship product, KYC Connect.
