To make sure you didn't miss the most important parts we've highlighted them for your in a review of the last year. In addition, we have our latest blog post, which looks at KYC and how it can be effectively conducted. Finally, we sit down with researcher and content producer Matthew Warner in our traditional 5 Minutes With section. We hope 2020 brings you happiness and prosperity and that you enjoy all the news and developments we will be bringing you!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3922\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-bal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>The First Partnership of 2020</strong>\r\nWe are proud to announce that the decentralized purchase, procurement and delivery platform BuyAnyLight (BAL) is the first new Blockpass partner to be announced in the new year and the new decade!
