    - 'On Wednesday the 11th March, more than a hundred people gathered in Canary Wharf for the Crypto A.M. Awards 2020. Undeterred by the current climate, or perhaps lured by the prestige and lucious setting, the attendees gathered at the Boisdale restaurant for drinks, lunch and the awards ceremony. Hosted by CITY A.M., the London-based free business-focussed newspaper, the inaugural Crypto A.M. Awards focused on some of the best and most innovative people and companies in London and the UK who are working in crypto, blockchain, AI, digital assets and DLT. There were a wide variety of people in attendance, some coming as individuals and some representing companies, but all were involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain scene in some way.  '
