    - "We also highlight the first in a series of articles that examine the necessity of developing and growing alongside new technology. In our <em>5 minutes With </em>section we sit down for a chat with Thomas Leiritz, Chief Technology Officer at Blockpass who leads the development of our revolutionary products and solutions. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5547\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/latoken.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>KYC and Listing on LATOKEN</strong>\r\nWe are always seeking to expand the availability of PASS tokens and this week we have the pleasure of announcing that we have partnered with a new exchange to enable the buying and selling of PASS. In addition, Blockpass will be providing electronic KYC for the exchange through our KYC Connect solution.\r\n\r\nBoasting over 300,000 registered traders and more than 320 crypto pairs available for trading, LATOKEN represents a great new opportunity to transact with PASS tokens.
