Rotbart &amp; Co., said: “For over 3,000 years, gold has served as a secure, stable and liquid asset, and we believe that there is no better way to secure investors’ future than by buying physical gold, especially in today’s volatile investment landscape. We are extremely pleased to offer Blockpass users access to this asset class, and to offer our clients an easy <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/09/23/understanding-kyc/\">KYC gateway</a> service such as Blockpass.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gold is a safe asset when the world is unstable and so is bitcoin now.
