Through the years, certain trends can be seen repeating whenever the chance for innovation or the advent of new technology comes along. By analysing these trends and extrapolating when new possibilities arise, the common pitfalls can be avoided and benefits can be taken advantage of.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we explore a case study of where new technology has overhauled an industry before, and what lessons can be taken from this and applied to other industries with the coming of blockchain technology. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2018/08/15/the-importance-of-embracing-new-technology-part-three-examples-from-the-past/?utm_source=sendgrid&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=website\">Click here</a> to read the third in the series: The Importance of Embracing New Technology.
