text: "We also continue our series looking at the impact that new technology brings, this week highlighting the benefits and dangers these opportunities can bring. For our <em>5 minutes With </em>interview this week we talk with Thien Tran, our Senior Mobile Engineer who works in our development team to create the products and solutions that bring regulatory compliance to the forefront of innovation. Read on to find out more!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-5556\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4609-ECXX-PASS-Listing-Tile-EMAIL-v1-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"Blockpass, Trading, PASS, ECXX, KYC, Regtech, Identity, eKYC, document check, document verification, KYC check, KYC verification, id check, best kyc, fast kyc, simple kyc, great kyc\" width=\"1024\" height=\"536\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>PASS Lists on Another New Exchange</strong>\r\nFollowing on from our news last week, we are excited to announce that PASS tokens will be listed on another new exchange this week. <a href=\"https://ecxx.com/\">Ecxx.com</a> is a digital asset exchange platform designed for both professional traders and retail investors boasting high liquidity. By continuing to expand the availability of PASS, we provide greater flexibility to those wishing to use it to show compliance with regulations and take control of their own identity.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for those who wish to get involved, there is a pool of 1,000,000 PASS on offer as a sign up bonus with <a href=\"https://ecxx.com/\">ecxx.com</a>! We always seek to reward people for taking their identity into their own hands and helping the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem move towards compliance so this kind of opportunity is something we are keen to see offered. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/03/04/blockpass-lists-pass-on-ecxx-expands-growing-network-of-exchanges/\">Click here</a> to read more about our PASS listing.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1132\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bp_slider.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1053\" height=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>The Role of Blockchain in Shipping and Supply Chains</strong>\r\nBlockchain-based solutions have the potential to revolutionise all manner of industries and services, but perhaps none so much as the shipping and supply chain industries. As two areas which still rely on inefficient paperwork methods of transacting, tracking and trading ownership, the digitisation, automisation and fraud prevention offered by blockchain has a significant opportunity to transform the way these industries operate for the better.\r\n\r\nDue to this potential, it is perhaps unsurprising that even fairly early on a number of big names in shipping and supply chain management began to research and develop blockchain solutions, with trials and proofs of concept proving successful. Regardless of the specifics of each solution, one thing is sure to be needed: identity. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2020/03/08/blockchain-for-shipping-logistics-and-provenance/\">Click here</a> to read about the role of blockchain in shipping, supply chains and provenance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Current Offers Available to PASS Club Members</strong>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3921\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bal-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"418\" height=\"64\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>BuyAnyLight</strong>\r\nA platform which has transformed the sourcing of LED lighting, BuyAnyLight (BAL) is Blockpass' latest partner.

This was seen a lot in the early days where everything suddenly had a 'blockchain solution' and where new coins and tokens were being created every day. The upshot of this, of course, was the failure of a number of projects as there was no real basis for their existence.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of possibilities opened up through innovation but there are also many pitfalls that people or companies can fall into. When looking at new technology, there are a number of considerations to make to decide whether it is worthwhile or not, and ignoring new technology simply because you already have a working solution carries its own risks. <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/01/10/the-importance-of-embracing-new-technology-part-two-the-benefits-and-dangers-of-innovation/\">Click here</a> to read the second in the series: The Importance of Embracing New Technology.
