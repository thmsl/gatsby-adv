    - "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting off with a small but important fix, an issue with <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2018/11/23/the-blockpass-app-now-supports-national-ids/\">National ID</a> pictures in the Mobile Application has been fixed. If you find any issues with parts of the app, have any suggestions for ways to improve it or would like to see additional features added, please get in touch with us to let us know.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the <a href=\"https://console.blockpass.org/blockpass_console\">KYC </a>Connect Dashboard, onprem dashboard installs now have the ability to request that users update their profiles without having to first reject an attribute - saving that little bit of extra time and hassle. The size of National ID pictures have been improved and the display of ID document certificates has been optimized. In addition, an issue around the display of the risk level field has been fixed.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the <a href=\"https://console.blockpass.org/blockpass_console\">Admin Console</a>, a number of fixes and adjustments have been made. Firstly, it is now possible to create a mailing list of all merchants in Sendgrid for transactional emails. Linked to this, current merchants have been migrated to the transactional mailing list. As part of the general update, the QR code widget has been replaced with the Web widget and there is now a new footer UI. From this new footer, merchants can now register the Blockpass Newsletter and legal term access is granted through it as well.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are constantly looking for new ways to improve our services. If you have any questions, thoughts or ideas, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us to discuss possibilities as we seek to provide the most beneficial features and options for merchants and individuals alike. Keep an eye out in the future to see new developments when we announce our next updates!\_</span>"
