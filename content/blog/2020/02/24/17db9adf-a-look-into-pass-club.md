The first of these to go live was an interview with Vincent Chok, CEO of Legacy Trust, one of Blockpass' partners. The second is an educational piece featuring a guide and overview to Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nWhilst we have many more of these planned, current health issues in Hong Kong are preventing us from filming and releasing these as often as we would like. We apologise for the delay in this type of content and hope you will find the other articles and news we are releasing interesting. In the meantime, please contact Blockpass with any requests for future webinar topics.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YOo5j8nFRm4\" width=\"100%\" height=\"406\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3677\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/KYC-Video-e1579536704909-1024x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>What to Expect from Exclusive Content</strong>\r\nAs PASS Club rolls out, some content will be accessible by and created exclusively for PASS Club members.
