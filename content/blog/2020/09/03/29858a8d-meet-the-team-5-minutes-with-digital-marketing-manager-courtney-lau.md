    - "<b>Where are you from and where do you live now?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and I’m currently based in Hong Kong.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your work background and how did you first get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked at 4As agency and managed finance industry related accounts. I found Fintech is the way to go and started looking for jobs in this field. I met a recruiter that introduced me to Blockpasss.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass and what does a typical day look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m the digital marketing manager at Blockpass. I oversee all digital marketing channels, including paid media and our own online properties like social media, YouTube channel, website content etc. A typical day for me would be reading news and see if we can explore interesting topics for our website content, managing marketing campaigns and posting on social media channels. Indeed, it’s very difficult to describe a typical day as it’s always changing and dynamic in Blockpass.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is something you’ve been proud of whilst working at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am proud of how far Blockpass and the Blockpass Identity Lab (BIL) have gone with the research about self-sovereign identity. It’s quite a groundbreaking idea and our team have together put theories in potential application in real life, and try to solve pain points of customers and businesses.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you think blockchain or crypto’s biggest potential is?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there is a lot of potential for blockchain because it’s the latest technology that can be applied in many industries to eliminate unnecessary human errors with high transparency in a secure environment. For crypto, the biggest potential is to avoid middlemen costs of\_ traditional assets, so that new projects can easily raise funds, and the decentralized characteristics may also benefit people who don’t have access to traditional financial institutions but with an internet connection.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think blockchain and crypto will be more mature in terms of market adoption. The general public will have more access and understanding towards these technologies.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Which hobby or activity are you particularly enjoying at the moment and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the pandemic, there is not much we can do. My favourite hobby/activity is watching Netflix, as there are so many TV shows and movies to choose from to keep me busy so I can stay home and stay safe!\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend a day with anyone, real or fictional, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be Stephen Hawking. I'd like to discuss time travelling, space and life. He seemed to be a humorous person too.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
