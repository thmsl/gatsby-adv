    - "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of the Blockpass Identity Lab team exclusively published articles including “</span><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02456\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Distributed Trust Framework for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ that will be presented at the 17th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Digital Business - </span><a href=\"http://www.dexa.org/trustbus2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TrustBus2020</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Bratislava, Slovakia on 14-17 September 2020.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lab Head William J. Buchanan OBE, Will Abramson, Owen Lo, Adam James Hall, Pavlos Papadopoulos and Nikolaos Pitropakis contributed to the paper. The paper details a proof of concept using Hyperledger Aries, Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to establish a distributed trust architecture during a privacy-preserving machine learning experiment. Specifically, they utilise secure and authenticated DID communication channels in order to facilitate a federated learning workflow related to mental health care data.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://identity-lab.blockpass.org/\">Blockpass Identity Lab</a> members also played a significant role in the research on “Privacy-Preserving Passive DNS” where they utilized Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain for storing and retrieving data to support the use of a passive DNS database for analysis and historical overview of data.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Buchanan also recently was an author of\_ “CASCF: Certificateless Aggregated SignCryption Framework for Internet-of-Things Infrastructure”, recently accepted for publication in a future issue of IEEE Access, as well as\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9095290\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Privacy Preserving Distributed Ledger Framework for Global Human Resource Record Management: The Blockchain Aspect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” , published in volume 8 of IEEE on 18 May 2020.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The quality of work and research that continues to come out of the BIL and Edinburgh Napier University is nothing short of outstanding.” said Blockpass CEO Adam Vaziri. “These advances will lead to the development of privacy-focussed, user-centric solutions that can solve some of the big problems we face in our society. We at Blockpass look forward to working on products that leverage these advances to provide the most secure and robust identity management for users and businesses alike.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Buchanan noted “We have repeatedly seen the danger of inadequate security and privacy measures in the wide range of data breaches and mishandling of data that we read about on a far-too regular basis. New technology and advanced cryptography hold the key to making sure our personal data and identities remain private. Working with Blockpass, we hope to continue working on and releasing more papers to advance this area.“</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass continues to be committed to decentralized digital identity (DDID), both through ongoing updates to its mobile identity vault in iOS and Android app stores and its support of the groundbreaking research at the Blockpass Identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Blockpass platform is fully automated and hosted in the cloud, with no integration or setup fee.
