    - "<b>Where are you from and where do you live now?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally I’m from Brazil and now I’m living in Peterborough, England.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your work background and how did you first get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became a lawyer in 2004 and worked in corporate law in Brazil before moving to the UK where I had the opportunity to diversify my skills. I ran my own property management company and a small law practice before joining Blockpass in 2018.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass and what does a typical day look like?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together with the compliance team my role is to work on the structure of Blockpass, making sure our contracts, policies and procedures are in line with applicable regulations. My day consists of attending meetings with the team and third parties as well as doing legal research and drafting.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is something you’ve been proud of whilst working at Blockpass?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is incredible to see the product developing and adapting to better serve our customers. Blockpass is constantly looking for ways to make digital identity easier, more accessible and compliant and that makes me proud to be part of the team.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do you think blockchain or crypto’s biggest potential is?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faster and more transparent transactions, be they financial, medical or educational transactions.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More education on decentralised solutions is still needed and simplification of processes too. I believe that the industry will naturally get more user friendly in order to accommodate users that want to enjoy the benefits of blockchain but have no specific technical knowledge.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Which hobby or activity are you particularly enjoying at the moment and why?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to say this pandemic made me rethink Kindle. I gave in a few months ago and now I cannot put it down. I cannot wait for the day when we can browse a bookshop again though.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend a day with anyone, real or fictional, who would it be and why?\_</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would love to spend a day with Frasier because it would be hilarious to observe his fancy routine up close!</span>"
