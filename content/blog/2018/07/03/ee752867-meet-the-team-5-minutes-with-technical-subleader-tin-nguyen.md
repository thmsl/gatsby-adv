text: "<strong>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</strong>My career started off at GameLoft (a famous mobile game company). I experienced various environments and roles in game development (Gameplay, VFX\_, Network ) and some interesting experiences as a SaiGon Technical Leader of <a href=\"https://www.what.games/en/\">WHAT Game</a>. After 6 years working on gaming industries, I slowly lost my interest and wanted to challenge myself in fintech. My new interest in blockchain technology.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</strong>I’m the Technical Leader for the Blockpass team. My main role is focused on working on the integration of external services with Blockpass along with developing API, Dashboard and SDK also. Supporting external service teams to ensure that their integration is smooth. I am also working on setting up some automation tools (Jenkins\_, Dockerlize) and bot testing. In my spare time, I usually take time to read news of blockchain technology, and think of ways to apply them to Blockpass.\r\n\r\n<strong>What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</strong>I start my working day discussing past tasks, current tasks, any issues that need technical support or business decisions, I collect and analyze feedback / suggestion / report error from external services and brainstorm about what we should do next to improve the Blockpass eco-systems. I usually work on prototypes first and analyze results with the team later on. Afternoons I usually spend about 1–2 hours to review and feedback team member pull requests.\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</strong>I knew Blockpass from Toan Hoang — my best colleague. That was first time I heard about blockchain. After a few months, I decided to join IBL (a top blockchain company in VietNam) and be a part of Blockpass.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</strong>The transparency. That is what makes blockchain different from other database solutions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</strong>Well I would hope to see blockchain become more scalable and solve more practical real-life problems.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</strong>I would choose Leonardo Da Vinci. I read a lot about his inventions and wonder how he could have sketched a tank, helicopter, parachute\_… from the late 15th century. Most of them have correct working principles similar to those found in the modern ones."
