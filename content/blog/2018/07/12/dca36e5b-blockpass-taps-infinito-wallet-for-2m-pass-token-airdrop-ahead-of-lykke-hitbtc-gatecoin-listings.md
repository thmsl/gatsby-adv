    - "<p id=\"8306\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The airdrop is being implemented through Blockpass’ joint venture partner Infinito Wallet — a universal cryptocurrency wallet. Infinito will have an airdrop link on the wallet dashboard on 12 July. The wallet is available in both <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.infinito.wallet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.infinito.wallet\">Android</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/infinito-wallet/id1315572736?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/infinito-wallet/id1315572736?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">iOS</a> app stores.</p>\r\n<p id=\"e0d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Infinito Wallet natively supports the PASS token as well as a long list of leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, GAS, Dash, ETC, and Dogecoin. It also supports tokens of ETH ERC20 and NEO NEP-5 standards, with more planned on Infinito’s roadmap.</p>\r\n<p id=\"e86b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Blockpass is a KYC identity application for bringing the blockchain industry into compliance and mainstream. As a self-sovereign identity platform, Blockpass users can establish, verify, store and manage their identities, maintaining full control over all data involved. With an initial focus on human identity, Blockpass will provide a reliable and cost-effective Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money-Laundering (“AML”) service for regulated industries, blockchain merchants and service providers.</p>\r\n<p id=\"2866\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Available on iOS and Android, the Blockpass app is consumer-oriented and will enable users to create a new account (profile), submit documents for verification, submit their digital identity to service providers to pass KYC, log in to Blockpass-enabled services, sign crypto-asset transactions, and access third-party decentralized applications (“Dapps”).</p>\r\n<p id=\"c6e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Blockpass CEO Adam Vaziri noted that the PASS airdrop was unique opportunity for users to get rewarded for doing the KYC process. Vaziri said, ”Get paid to do your KYC. [This is a] once in a lifetime opportunity to be compensated as a user to get verified. Blockpass airdrop is to help you get verified and make your life easier every time you sign up with a service provider. One click and you are there!”</p>\r\n<p id=\"b6c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Verified users of Blockpass do not need to do KYC again to use any financial services and ICOs that may be on the Blockpass platform. Merchants and financial services that use Blockpass to verify their users KYC data at a significant discount. Blockpass does not keep any data of users of its platform</p>\r\n<p id=\"f784\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Blockpass began its token distribution event on 31 May 2018, and has just released the third version of its platform in <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockpass_mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockpass_mobile\">Google Android</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blockpass/id1322917010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blockpass/id1322917010\">Apple iOS</a>appstores.</p>"
