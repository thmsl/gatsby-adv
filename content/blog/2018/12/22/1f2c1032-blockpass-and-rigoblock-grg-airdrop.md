text: "<b>How it works\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://rigoblock.com/\">RigoBlock</a> GRG Airdrop will run for one month, from 22 December 2018 to 19 January 2019. To participate, all you need to do is ensure you have activated your <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/token\">PASS</a> Tokens with a valid Blockpass verified identity and you will automatically be registered for the Airdrop. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already have activated your verified PASS Tokens, you will receive your GRG Token on Saturday 22 December. All participants who create a Blockpass verified identity and activate their PASS Tokens thereafter will receive a GRG Token at the end of the campaign. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>How To Create Your Blockpass Verified Identity\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy. Download the Blockpass Identity Application from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockpass/id1322917010\">App Store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockpass_mobile&amp;hl=en_US\">Google Play</a> onto your mobile device and register using your email. Follow the prompts to upload your documents and when ready hit submit. Your Blockpass Identity should be verified in a couple of minutes, and you will receive certificates to your profile based on these verifications. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>How to Activate Your PASS Tokens\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have created your Blockpass verified identity, go back to home page and select tab “Your services”:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap on “Activate your Pass tokens” &gt; More info</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The screen shows required fields</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all required fields are already filled, the button “Register” is enabled</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap “Register”</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the next screen, select available certificates to add to registration</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certificates are optional, whitelisting can be done without providing certificates</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a user already whitelisted an address before, he can provide the certificate that was issued by the PASS token Activation service to speed up verifications</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confirm information and upload to the Pass activation service</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For full details on how to set up your Blockpass profile and activate your tokens, visit: </span><a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2018/07/06/step-by-step-user-guide-to-activating-pass-tokens/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.blockpass.org/2018/07/06/step-by-step-user-guide-to-activating-pass-tokens/</span></a>"
