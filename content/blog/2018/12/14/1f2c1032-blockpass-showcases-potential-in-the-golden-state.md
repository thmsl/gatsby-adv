intro: "If you were going to California last month you may have met Blockpass at the Blockchain Expo North America.

text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of blockchain companies were in attendance, with Blockpass and Infinito manning a joint stand to show off their respective products and joint developments through their partnership. On stage, Dr <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanslombardo/\">Hans Lombardo</a> spoke on Blockpass’ vision of being an ‘Identity for a Connected World’, explaining the potential of Blockpass to enable a simple and efficient <a href=\"http://www.blockpasss.org/kyc\">KYC solution</a> as well as other developments that are in the works. The Blockpass booth was busy and attendees were able to see live demonstrations of the app and hear about current goals and future plans. The team made a number of interesting contacts and looks forward to continuing conversations and creating potential partnerships. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk at the convention revolved around a number of blockchain and cryptocurrency topics but by far the most prevalent was discussion around the potential use of security tokens and how they will change the way business can be conducted. At the Blockpass stand we were keen to discuss this as Blockpass and Infinito Wallet have been working to launch a KYC-enabled security token wallet which has <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2018/12/12/blockpass-and-infinito-wallet-launch-most-secure-kyc-enabled-security-token-wallet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently been announced</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This conference marked the final significant event for Blockpass in this calendar year and it has been a pleasure to meet so many people and companies that share our passion for KYC and identity (and making it quick, simple and user-centric). It has been a busy but fruitful twelve months which has led to a number of implementations and partnerships - something we will continue to announce in the following weeks and work to expand on in 2019. Keep an eye out early next year as we announce events that we will be attending. We hope to see you there!</span>"
