text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born in Riga, Latvia and I have lived here for all my life. I studied finance in the University of Latvia and worked as a sales person in different industries, including banking. For approximately 5 years before joining Blockpass I was working as a private banker/client manager in small, private boutique banks here in Latvia, where I gained most of my experience about banking, KYC/AML requirements and corporate laws. Having different business clients also allowed me to gain insights and understanding of various types of businesses and industries.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I manage and foresee different business-related operations.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few calls, lots of e-mails, lots of thinking. Blockpass is a start-up so tasks for the role I take are quite different. Basically, you could say that I am managing different projects that are important for the operations of the company. Additionally, I do some compliance-related tasks.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met the CEO of Blockpass approximately 4-5 years ago, when even the idea of Blockpass wasn’t born yet, I guess. After a few years, when I decided to change some things in my life and left my job in the bank, he offered me the opportunity to join the team.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate blockchain technology as a whole. It can provide different benefits for different industries and I don’t think you need to pick a particular one.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could actually take more years for the industry to mature, but I still think that we are heading in a right direction. Investors and the public are becoming more educated and there are fewer ICO scams. There is still a lot of work to do, but I can’t wait to see how the world will change when the technology reaches mass adoption.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is a very tough question. Myself, maybe (since everything in my past is now my history)? Nobody could teach me anything better than myself as I have already lived through it. It would be like going back in time to give myself advice.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get in touch with Ruslan, email <a href=\"mailto:ruslan.tarasov@blockpass.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruslan.tarasov@blockpass.org\_</a></span>"
