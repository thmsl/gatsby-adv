    - "PASS Tokens enable Blockpass to offer shared regulatory compliance services for humans, companies, objects and devices. The <a href=\"http://blockpass.org/token\">PASS Token</a> is an ERC20 KYC standard utility token that serves as a discount token on the Blockpass platform.\r\n\r\nThe Initial TDE not only helped to build Blockpass’ brand exposure globally, it also encouraged a growing ecosystem of partners, distributors and exchanges to become involved with Blockpass.\r\n\r\nIf you missed out on a chance to participate in our Initial TDE, there will be an opportunity to get involved with Blockpass and purchase PASS Tokens during our Second and Third TDE’s which will run from May 31 - November 30 2019, and May 31 - November 30 2020 consecutively.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the PASS Token, <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/token\">click here</a>."
