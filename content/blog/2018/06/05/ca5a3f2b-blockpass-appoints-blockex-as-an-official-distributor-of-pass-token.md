    - "The BlockEx Digital Asset Exchange Platform (DAxP) manages the entire lifecycle of blockchain based digital assets, including origination, issuance, exchange, settlement and redemption. The DAxP includes a digital asset creation tool, exchange, clearing, settlement, registry and Brokerage Software.\r\n\r\nBlockpass is a blockchain-based identity verification application that supports user-centric digital identity creation facilitating seamless and cost-effective access to regulated blockchain services and connected devices. The fully-functioning Blockpass application supports both iOS and Android and allows users to have complete control over their identity data, allowing for greater security, protection, and user data independence. For businesses, Blockpass offers a comprehensive identity verification portal for quick and easy user onboarding.\r\n\r\nPASS Tokens, due to be released on May 31st, enable Blockpass to offer shared regulatory compliance services for humans, companies, objects and devices. PASS Tokens will be released in a world-first Token Distribution Event, supported by a list of distributors which now includes BlockEx. Contributors will be able to purchase PASS tokens through Blockpass’ official distributor network using the Blockpass app and a newly verified identity.<em>\_</em>\r\n\r\n<em>“We’re very enthusiastic about this new partnership with BlockEx as distributor of the PASS token, but also as an opportunity to expand the Blockpass user base,” said Blockpass CEO Adam Vaziri. “This is one more step in growing our shared compliance and regulatory ecosystem.”</em>\r\n\r\n<em>According to BlockEx CEO, Adam Leonard, “Becoming a distributor of the PASS token means we are supporting a more compliant regulated token ecosystem. It gives us the opportunity to grow and evolve with the changing landscape of the blockchain economy.”</em>\r\n\r\nBlockpass has announced a number of different partnerships lately, including Holdex, Myki, and Infinito Wallet. In addition, in April of this year, Blockpass announced the creation of the Blockpass Identity Lab — a pioneering research lab which will explore ways in which blockchain technology can protect personal data from online scammers and hackers."
