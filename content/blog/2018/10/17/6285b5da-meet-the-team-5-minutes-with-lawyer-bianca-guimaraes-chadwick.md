text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am originally from Brazil, where I qualified as a lawyer in 2004, moving to England in 2005 to further my studies. I worked in hospitality and management before opening a law firm in 2014, where I dealt with civil and commercial litigation matters.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am part of the legal team at Blockpass. We build the legal framework to support the company’s activities. We draft all the boring documents nobody wants to read (Terms and conditions, anyone?!) but they are crucial to regulate and protect ourselves, our partners and customers.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of drafting, reading emails and telegram messages, trying not to drink too many coffees and doing research. When I’m working from home, I also keep my greyhound Willow company!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had the great opportunity to join the team just before the launch at the beginning of 2018. I’ve enjoyed adapting to new challenges and I would not change a thing.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain-related benefit?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The possibility of using services across borders, instantly and safely.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully the industry will move towards educating new users who are not familiar with the technology but want to benefit from the use of blockchain, or even to become developers themselves. \_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina Fey and Amy Poehler because it would be a very funny hour. And they’re alive so I still have a chance!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get in touch with Bianca, email <a href=\"mailto:bianca.guimaraes-chadwick@blockpass.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bianca.guimaraes-chadwick@blockpass.org\_</a></span>"
