text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://dstoq.com/\">DSTOQ</a> is a licensed stock exchange that enables traders to invest in real-world assets. Right from the DSTOQ app, users can trade the DSQ token for tokenized securities like equities, stocks, bonds, as well as for commodities like oil and gold. DSTOQ is built with a global outlook, describing itself as an “exchange without borders.” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass is a <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/digital-identity/\">digital identity</a> verification software that supports user-centric identity creation. The Blockpass user app facilitates seamless and cost-effective access to regulated blockchain services and connected devices. Blockpass users will be able to use their digital identities to access the DSTOQ platform in just a few clicks. DSTOQ’s existing user base, owing to Blockpass integration, will be able to enjoy a higher level of ease-of-access to the growing ecosystem of compliant decentralized financial tools. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our biggest goal is to make capital markets accessible to everyone, no matter where they are from,” said DSTOQ CEO Craig Mc Gregor. “Blockpass and DSTOQ share the vision that licensed and legally compliant solutions are required in order to propel the security token industry forward. Blockpass is one of the few blockchain based KYC providers that is already operational which is why we are very pleased to have partnered up with them for our platform.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Token finance is well on its way to becoming an essential part of the worldwide financial system,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaziri/\">Adam Vaziri</a>, CEO of Blockpass. “DSTOQ is really out ahead of the pack in their way of tokenizing securities. We look forward to working together to craft compliant solutions for the next generation of finance.” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several steps of collaboration have already between planned between the two teams, beginning initially with the integration of Blockpass’ user identity verification platform, <a href=\"http://www.blockpasss.org/kyc\">KYC Connect</a>, into the DSTOQ trading platform. </span>"
