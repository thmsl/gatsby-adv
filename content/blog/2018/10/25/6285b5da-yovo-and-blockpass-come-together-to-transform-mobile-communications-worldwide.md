text: "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://ww.yovo.io\">YOVO</a> is a mobile network built on the Stellar blockchain that is committed to openness, fairness, and transparency. As a company, YOVO builds privacy into everything they do. YOVO offers a range of innovative SIM-based mobile products and with YOVO Pay, it is also possible for users to pay for their current mobile service in cryptocurrency (in any of over 130 countries), without having to change their network or SIM. What’s more, the next generation YOVO GO service makes it possible to have up to four extra numbers on a single device with a virtual SIM.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass is <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/digital-identity/\">digital identity application</a> and service which brings control back to the user. Blockpass provides a streamlined and <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">cost-effective user onboarding</a> process for regulated industries and any kind of online service. From the Blockpass application, users can create, store, and manage, data-secure digital identity that can be used for an entire ecosystem of services or token purchase. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Integration of YOVO and Blockpass will make signing up for mobile service faster and more secure than it has ever been before. It will only take a few moments for new users to start using YOVO services. YOVO users can then be sure that they are in full control of their own personal information.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“We are committed to driving adoption of blockchain, and mobility is the perfect channel to reach just about everyone on the planet,” said Richard Skaife, CEO and Co-Founder at YOVO. “Your smartphone is easily the most valuable device in your life and our partnership with Blockpass ensures it is protected from many of the known security and identity issues that mobile users face.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“YOVO is a really exciting partnership for Blockpass,” said Blockpass CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaziri/\">Adam Vaziri</a>. “The addition of a mobile network is unlike any other partner we have added to our ecosystem to date and brings very exciting possibilities to our network.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The partnership comes after Blockpass announced last week that token-trading platform Ethfinex would integrate its solution as part of their standard compliant ICO solution. Blockpass also launched a world-first advanced blockchain identity research laboratory, the Blockpass Identity Lab at the end of September in collaboration with Edinburgh Napier University.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About Blockpass IDN</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal of Blockpass IDN (<a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/\"><span class=\"s2\">http://www.blockpass.org/</span></a>) is global realization of identity for the Internet of Everything. Through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, Blockpass is a production ready Regtech platform offering shared regulatory and compliance services for humans, businesses, objects and devices. As this identity system supports verification of humans (KYC), objects (KYO) and connected devices (KYD), it will enable the development of new applications that rely on a trusted connection between human, corporate, and device identities. Registered in Hong Kong, Blockpass IDN is a joint venture of Infinity Blockchain Labs and Chain of Things. Blockpass IDN licenses its technology from the non-profit Blockpass Foundation, registered in the Isle of Man.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">For more information and updates, please visit and sign up to the following:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s3\">Promotional video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SvO2cw3e-SI\"><span class=\"s4\">https://youtu.be/SvO2cw3e-SI</span></a>\r\n</span><span class=\"s3\">Website:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\_ </span><a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org\"><span class=\"s4\">http://www.blockpass.org</span></a>\r\n</span><span class=\"s3\">Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blockpass\"><span class=\"s4\">https://medium.com/@blockpass\\</span></a>\r\n</span><span class=\"s3\">Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlockpassOrg\"><span class=\"s4\">https://twitter.com/BlockpassOrg</span></a>\r\n</span><span class=\"s3\">Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blockpassorg/\"><span class=\"s4\">https://www.facebook.com/blockpassorg/</span></a>\r\n</span><span class=\"s3\">Telegram:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\_ </span><a href=\"https://t.me/blockpass\"><span class=\"s4\">https://t.me/blockpass</span></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About YOVO</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">YOVO is the mobile network on the blockchain.
