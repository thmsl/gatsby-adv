text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in London and worked primarily in property management and development whilst studying for my Masters in Corporate Law. I then moved into corporate structuring and consultancy work for blockchain startups. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work in the legal and regulatory department at Blockpass, working hard to make the innovative and exciting work of the Blockpass team practical and compliant. Essentially I’m a professional kill-joy!</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tend to jump from one project and department to another. No two days are the same and I love that aspect of the job. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last few years I have been working for a regulatory compliance consultancy specialising in supporting blockchain related businesses and that invariably led me to Blockpass; a brilliant team and a brilliant concept.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given recent developments, voting verification through the blockchain seems particularly pertinent. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m most excited to see Google’s development of blockchain technology as I see it as a massive step towards bringing blockchain into the mainstream consciousness. I can imagine a time in the next couple of years where I won’t have to keep explaining what I do at parties!</span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arsène Wenger. I’m a massive football and Arsenal nerd and I’ve always seen Arsène as an aspirational character, a football purist who would never compromise his own ideals to win a game of football...sadly. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get in touch with Ajit, email <a href=\"mailto:ajit.nayar@blockpass.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ajit.nayar@blockpass.org</a></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
