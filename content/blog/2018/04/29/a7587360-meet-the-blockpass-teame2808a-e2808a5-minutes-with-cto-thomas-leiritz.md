    - "<p id=\"81bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</strong>I am originally from France. I started my career as web developer in a startup back in 1999. We created an online imagery database of aerial pictures taken by helicopter, it was kind of like a precursor of Google Maps\_:) In 2001, I left France for Istanbul, Turkey where I stayed 6 years. Then, I moved to South East Asia. Vietnam was just starting to open up to the world and posed amazing opportunities. I joined a software outsourcing company for several years then I co-founded a web and mobile agency, that was eventually killed by the financial crisis in 2015. Like many people in the industry, I was following the blockchain and crypto revolution. In 2016, I finally decided to join it and learned the technology around it.</p>\r\n<p id=\"8ad3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</strong>I am the CTO and in charge of the product.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</strong>Everyday is a new adventure in the crypto world and in a early stage startup. Most difficult part of the job is to mitigate technical debt in an ever-changing environment. Security is of course our main focus, we spend a huge amount of time to test and audit our tools.</p>\r\n<p id=\"f86a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</strong>Through our joint-venture partner, Infinity Blockchain Labs that is based in Vietnam. I have been involved with the Blockpass project from the very beginning.</p>\r\n<p id=\"60fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</strong>Nobody owns a blockchain or everybody does. It's decentralised and immutable. There is no equivalence in software or other industries. Developers can now access a whole new dimension that was previously obfuscated by trust issues.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ba33\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</strong>I hope we can reach a point in time where nobody talks about blockchain anymore. It will become an obvious, simple and efficient solution for most industries.</p>\r\n<p id=\"49ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</strong>I wouldn't do that. 'The encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space time continuum, and destroy the entire universe! Granted, that's a worse case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy' - Dr Emmett Brown.</p>\r\n<p id=\"017d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">— <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Thomas Leiritz is the CTO of Blockpass.
