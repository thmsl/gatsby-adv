intro: 'Following the roaring success of the Blockchain Expo in the Kensington Olympia, the Blockpass team hosted its own event after the expo ended at the Design Museum — located a stone’s throw away from the exhibition centre. On the evening of the 19th of April, the team and guests gathered to enjoy drinks and canapes and to celebrate the launch of the Blockpass app, amongst other milestones.'
text: "<p id=\"c773\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As the main focus for the event, the launch of the first version of the Blockpass app to the app store and google play was officially announced, with Chief Marketing Officer Hans Lombardo introducing Adam Vaziri, Blockpass CEO, to talk about the Blockpass vision and potential to revolutionise the way that regulation and KYC is carried out. Also introduced by Lombardo, representatives of Coinfirm and Infinito — two of the initial partners of Blockpass which have been announced previously — spoke on their ingenious blockchain solutions and how the companies would work together to produce greater results. As part of the event, CTO Thomas Leiritz gave a live demo of the app working.</p>\r\n<p id=\"6fc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">However, something that was not expected by the guests was the ground breaking announcement that came alongside the product launch with the revelation of a partnership between Blockpass and Edinburgh Napier University. An initiative that had been kept under wraps until its first official announcement at the launch party, the exciting development will see the Blockpass Identity Lab established at the university that will explore a number of ways that blockchain technology can serve the world by securing data with the privacy of the user as its focus. Liam Bell, a Research Fellow at the university’s Centre for Distributed Computing, Network and Security spoke passionately about the possibilities that this partnership will bring.</p>\r\n<p id=\"8f8d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">With the release of the first version of the app, people are able to create an identity for use in KYC applications whilst remaining in full control of their data. Future versions of the app will allow for further information to be added to the app to build a complete profile of the user for them to use in a digital and blockchain ecosystem. Further down the line, solutions will give devices and objects their own identity to enable a secure IoT ecosystem. Before then, Blockpass has committed to building an network of human identities and with the apps launch this has now begun.</p>"
