text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and brought up here in Hong Kong and completed my studies in the UK. Prior to working at Blockpass, I was working as a Project Manager in the financial industry for delivering IPO projects and assisting in the listing process in both HKEx and the US SEC.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am currently working as a Project Manager here at Blockpass. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/atif-mohammad-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I focus on putting together the final deliverables across different departments to streamline the overall operations.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a year ago, I realized how the financial industry will change in the future due to the blockchain technology, which is why I started searching for a new challenge and a company with vision in Blockchain and that is how i came across Blockpass. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favourite thing about Blockchain technology is how it can fit right into any industry that shares or holds information. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Blockchain industry still has some time to go before it can be fully adapted into the real world scenarios. However, with the right vision and goals, the Blockchain industry can be a real benefit to the current system in every sector of our society in the next 5 years. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not in history but I would mention Vitalik Buterin and Satoshi Nakamoto because I would like to talk about their standpoint and understand their vision for Blockchain industry.</span>"
