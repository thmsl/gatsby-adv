    - "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</b>I am originally from Rhode Island, the smallest American state. My background is in content marketing, but always in relation to technology.\r\n\r\nI originally got into copywriting for blockchain while I was living in Russia; in 2016, there was an explosion of growth in the crypto scene there. Hundreds of projects, good and bad, were coming out of the woodwork every day. I was initially approached to do some translation - white papers, press releases, blogs. Gradually, I started to write these things from scratch. The rest is history, I suppose.\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</b>I am a Content Specialist and Business Developer. I contribute to the documentation - marketing materials and some technical documentation as well. I am also involved in Blockpass sales in Europe and Central Asia - particularly in Russian speaking regions.\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</b>Writing, thinking - lots of coffee, e-mails, and Telegram messages.\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</b>I worked with Adam Vaziri on a few other projects in the past. Initially, for Blockpass, I came on just to do some work on the white paper. Within a short time I was hired as a member of the team.\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</b>Anything that contributes to “borderlessness”. I am an American expat living in the former Soviet Union and I live a life where I am constantly being restricted by some inane law or unthought-through regulation. I think blockchain can fix this someday.\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</b>Well, I at least know that blockchain is well on its way to being something more than just fintech. Do I think our grandmothers will have cryptocurrency wallets? No. But it is clear we will be interfacing with the technology in many, many ways on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</b>Maybe Thomas Jefferson - maybe some other historical autodidact. With the advent of digital delivery of content, autodidactism has been seeing quite the come back. It would be interesting to discuss that with him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo get in touch with David, email <a href=\"mailto:david.langellotti@blockpass.org\">david.langellotti@blockpass.org</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
