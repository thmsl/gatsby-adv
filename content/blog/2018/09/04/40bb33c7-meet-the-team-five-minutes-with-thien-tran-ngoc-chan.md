    - "<strong>Where are you from and what is your work background?</strong>\r\nI was born and grew up in Saigon. After high school, I studied maths at university and graduated in 2009. Most of my classmates chose to become a teacher, or pursue higher education, but I decided to become a programmer. I started off programming with Java and related technologies. At that time, my role was a DevOps. I was exposed to many types of products, such as games, payments and advertising systems.\r\n\r\nIn mid-2016, I wanted expand my knowledge and expertise in mobile and blockchain. They're literally interesting to me.\r\n\r\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1248 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Image-from-iOS-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"462\" height=\"346\" />\r\nWhat is your role at Blockpass?</strong>\r\nI'm responsible for developing the Blockpass mobile app. It's published on both Android and iOS.\r\n\r\n<strong>What do your daily activities look like?</strong>\r\nI usually start the day with checking Asana, where we store our project progress, all task updates and details. When the team arrives we usually do a casual daily meeting either face-2-face or on Skype. We usually discuss past tasks, current tasks, any issues that need technical support or business decisions.\r\n\r\nI found that afternoon is the best time for me to concentrate on my own technical tasks, or reading some Medium/Quora articles because the office is pretty quiet at that time.\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you get involved in Blockpass?</strong>\r\nI consider myself fortunate to be a part of the Blockpass team. In the end of 2017, my ex-project was shutdown by users cheating payments. At that time, I started looking for a new path, and became interested in blockchain, the technology can make everything be transparent with high security.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I got an opportunity to join Infinity Blockchain Labs, a joint-venture partner of Blockpass. And now I'm a part of the Blockpass team.\r\n\r\n<strong>Whatâ€™s your favourite blockchain related benefit?</strong>\r\nBeside the transparency that people are discussing, I want to mention security. These two most important reasons make blockchain standout from traditional systems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</strong>\r\nAccording to what I learnt and experienced in blockchain, I believe within 2 years blockchain will advance very fast to a new level. Going post-Quantum may be the next trending technology after blockchain.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?</strong>\r\nI would love to meet the man who invented the first decrypting the Enigma Cipher machine, Alan Turing. I'm actually fascinated by what he did. His works are proof for the famous quote of Thomas Edison, \"Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.\""
