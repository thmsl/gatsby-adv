    - "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On both days, Blockpass CMO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanslombardo/\">Dr. Hans Lombardo</a> presented about Blockpass and its potential to change how <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a> is performed. On the Thursday evening, Dr. Lombardo represented Blockpass on a panel discussing ‘Blockchain Empowerment and Innovation’, describing the importance of <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/05/16/the-question-of-self-sovereignty/\">self-sovereign identity</a> and the need for improvement of KYC to enable personal data to be put back under the control of the user, particularly in the blockchain ecosystem. On the second day, Dr. Lombardo showcased the Blockpass Identity Network in a tech demo, answering questions on its current uses and potential in various industries.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the recent dip in cryptocurrency markets, enthusiasm for crypto and blockchain projects was high and the event hall was packed with people talking to exhibitors. The Blockpass booth was busy with interested parties discussing its possible uses and partnerships with companies working in industries such as education, investment and for projects carrying out token offerings or requiring KYC services. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Networking and discussions continued outside the exhibition centre, with evening events and planned socialising opportunities allowing for discussions to take place in more informal settings such as baseball stadiums, bars and clubs, including Boston’s Club Royale where attendees met on the last day for a night of dancing and some last-minute conversations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass continues to attend events globally in order to provide information on our goals, services and demonstrate how our products can help improve compliance and regulatory processes. You can always contact us with questions via our social media channels and we hope to see you at one of the next events we are at, such as the following:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain Identity Lab Launch – 26 September – Edinburgh\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ScotSoft – 27 September – Edinburgh\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BIL 2018 Conference – 28 September – Edinburgh\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BIL Hack#1 – 29-30 September – Edinburgh\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Identity World – 29-31 October – Amsterdam\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fintech Week HK – 29 October -2 November – Hong Kong\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Crypto Con –30 October -2 November – Las Vegas\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Blockchain Forum – 8-9 November – New York</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
