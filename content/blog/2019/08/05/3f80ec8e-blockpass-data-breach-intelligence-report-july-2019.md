    - "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of the largest hacks this month individually affected more people than the total of people affected last month; although one one the incidents reported is an update to one from the previous month, as the Evite hack was found to be significantly worse than initially thought. This month also sees repeat hacks for other companies and a large number of US victims.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst these ten instances are the only ones covered this month, it should be noted that the vast majority of data breach events are not discovered or reported until well after they happen. Also this month we begin to see the effects of GDPR come in as big names receive even bigger fines from failing to protect personal data. These sorts of failings and fines are exactly the type of thing Blockpass hopes to prevent.\_</span>\r\n<table style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong># of Events Analyzed</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong># of Identities Lost</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt; 216,333,724</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong>% of World Population</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt;2.87%</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong>Industry Hardest Hit</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>Capital One | Banking | over 106,000,000\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming in at the end of the month, it was reported that US Capital One customers had been the victim of a significant data breach following the actions of a former employee of an Amazon.com Inc. cloud service. The woman in question has since been arrested but the data, which reportedly went missing at some time in the past 5 months, affected over 100 million people, with the majority in the US but 6 million from Canada.\_\_\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stolen data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, self-reported income, credit scores and elements of transaction histories. 140,000 individual’s social security numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers are also believed to have been leaked.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/capital-one-data-systems-breached-by-seattle-woman-u-s-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/capital-one-data-systems-breached-by-seattle-woman-u-s-says</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49159859\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49159859</span></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/what-we-can-learn-from-the-capital-one-hack/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/what-we-can-learn-from-the-capital-one-hack/</span></a>\r\n\r\n<b>\r\nEvite\_ | Social Planning | 101,000,000\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally reported last month, the Evite hack was originally thought to have affected 10 million individuals, but in the last few weeks has been revealed to have impacted closer to 101 million people - 10 times the number originally thought. The new information was brought to light by internet security website </span><a href=\"http://haveibeenpwned.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">haveibeenpwned.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which made the announcement following their receipt of a database containing new information.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the data was claimed to be from no later than 2013, it is thought to include names, usernames, email addresses, passwords, dates of birth, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and genders.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://gdpr.report/news/2019/07/16/evite-data-breach-bigger-than-initially-thought/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://gdpr.report/news/2019/07/16/evite-data-breach-bigger-than-initially-thought/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>National Revenue Agency | Government | 5,000,000\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar vein to in incident a few months ago in Panama, more or less an entire country was found to have been hacked this month when the Bulgarian tax authority suffered a huge data breach, affecting approximately 5 in every 7 Bulgarians nationals and residents. There is speculation that that hack was politically motivated and was carried out by a Russian source.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information taken included names, addresses, incomes and social security information. The hacker sent an email to Bulgarian media afterwards to mock the cybersecurity standards of the government. The tax agency faces a hefty fine for the data breach.\_\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/world/europe/bulgaria-hack-cyberattack.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Permalink/europe/bulgaria-hack-cyberattack.html</span></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49015511\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49015511</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>American Medical Collection Agency\_ | Healthcare | 2,200,000\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another update to June data breach intelligence report, the American Medical Collection Agency hack was found to involve the records of an extra 2.2 million individuals when the Texan-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories was discovered to have been compromised. Previous companies that came under the AMCA hack include Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, BioReference Laboratories, Carecentrix and Sunrise Laboratories. This latest development brings the running total of people affected by the AMCA hack up to over 22,722,600.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US patients were the ones affected by this breach, which divulged patient names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, dates of service, account balance details, credit card or banking information, and provider data. Clinical Pathology Laboratories has since terminated its working relationship with the AMCA.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://healthitsecurity.com/news/2.2m-clinical-pathology-patients-included-in-amca-data-breach\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://healthitsecurity.com/news/2.2m-clinical-pathology-patients-included-in-amca-data-breach</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Flash Flash Revolution | Gaming | 1,858,124\r\n</b><a href=\"http://haveibeenpwned.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haveibeenpwned.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported, with information from </span><a href=\"http://dehashed.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dehashed.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, another data breach this month with the game Flash Flash Revolution found to have lost data from over 1.8 million individuals.

Through this method, attackers can infect computers with malware, potentially gaining control of people’s computers and the information stored within.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of consequences from having a compromised computer which includes stealing banking details, app logins, usurping computer power to run programmes, and redirecting users with false adverts or websites. To combat these types of attacks and the effects of malware, it is recommended that users maintain the latest anti-virus software.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ncsc-dns-hijackers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ncsc-dns-hijackers/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ongoing-dns-hijacking-and-mitigation-advice\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ongoing-dns-hijacking-and-mitigation-advice</span></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Maryland Dept. of Labor\_ | Employment | 78,000\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vulnerabilities in old databases are thought to have led to a data breach this month that impacted people who had received unemployment benefits or applied for a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) in Maryland, USA. An unemployment insurance database and adult literacy database are believed to have been the databases in question, with names and social security numbers being taken.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maryland has been the location for a number of hacks in the past few years. The state governor has since dedicated increased resources to cyber security and state officials have offered compensation to those affected in this attack.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/dept-labor-reveals-data-breach-222823513.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://news.yahoo.com/dept-labor-reveals-data-breach-222823513.html</span></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-data-breach-accessed-up-to-78000-names-and-social-security-numbers/2019/07/05/a14c2760-9f41-11e9-85d6-5211733f92c7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.dc2d69ddd807\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-data-breach-accessed-up-to-78000-names-and-social-security-numbers/2019/07/05/a14c2760-9f41-11e9-85d6-5211733f92c7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.dc2d69ddd807</span></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Los Angeles County Department of Health Services\_ | Healthcare | 14,600\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthcare continues to suffer in data breaches recently with news revealed this month of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services falling prey to a phishing attack. An employee of a contractor, Nemadji Research Corporation, had their account compromised, which led to the exposure of personal information of almost 15,000 patients.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Names, addresses, phone numbers and patient information were all exposed, along with the social security numbers of at least two patients.

The services of Vitagene Inc. are used by customers for dieting and exercise planning, but the information involved can be used to ascertain other details.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This highly sensitive data was comprised of full names, dates of birth and gene-based health information including the likelihood of developing specific medical conditions.

Whilst this is a significant fine, it pales in comparison to the </span><a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/facebook-set-for-record-5bn-ftc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$5 billion fine being levied against Facebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the data misuse in the Cambridge Analytica event.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst companies remain in control of user data, these types of events and fines are likely to remain commonplace. Hopefully, in the near future, Blockpass will be able to confine these types of news story to the annals of history.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This report, for the month of July, is the ninth of our Data Breach Intelligence Reports. We encourage the Blockpass community and anyone who might be otherwise interested to let us know what kinds of information they would like to see provided in future reports by contacting us at marketing@blockpass.org under the subject line “Suggestions for the blog.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you believe you have been the victim of a data breach there may be resources available to help you; check with the relevant company to find out any details you can and see what their recommendations are. You can contact the security services for your country to intervene or ask for guidance on security forums online.\_</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
