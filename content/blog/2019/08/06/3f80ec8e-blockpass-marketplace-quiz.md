    - "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Blockpass website you can now find the all new </span><a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/marketplace\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketplace</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which provides an easy route for users to find and sign up for campaigns, exchanges, wallets and other services that have integrated with Blockpass.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Marketplace is designed to be a one-stop shop for those looking to use their Blockpass identity to access services and opportunities where they remain in control of their personal information. Blockpass is a one-click compliance gateway to financial services, regulated offerings and virtual banking. Companies such as Tokenomica, Glenbit and Korporatio are featured, with a short description and links to more detailed information to allow users to quickly and clearly see the opportunities opened to them by using their Blockpass identity. In the future, the marketplace will introduce even more partnerships and campaigns as Blockpass continues to grow, and additional functionality will be added to provide simple sign-up options and facilitate participation in special events.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To celebrate this milestone, and following great public demand, Blockpass is happy to announce the return of the </span><a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/quiz\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass Quiz</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! Those familiar with the original quizzes will note that the format will be slightly different this time, though the prize is much larger.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Blockpass Quiz will consist of a number of questions which will be sent out via email to those that register to participate using their Blockpass identity. Once the registration period concludes on 15 August 2019 at 10 am GMT, an email containing the questions will be sent out to those that registered. The first person to reply to the email with the correct answers to all of the questions will be awarded $1000USD in PASS!\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions will vary from general crypto knowledge to the history of blockchain, and from technical questions to those on current crypto events. You can expect a number of questions to focus around Blockpass and its partners, so keep the whitepaper and the website at hand.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you have created your Blockpass identity in order to register for the quiz. You can find the registration link </span><a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/quiz\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
