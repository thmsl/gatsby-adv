text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Hong Kong before going to university in the US to get my bachelor degree. Since then I have been working in 4A advertising agencies, mainly handling online advertising campaigns.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work on different digital marketing channels, social media and helping with events etc.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At work, I usually check and respond to emails and messages, make some calls and go through a number of different tasks depending on the day. If I have time after work, I will work out, hang out with friends or watch a movie to relax!</span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I joined the team less than a month ago after meeting with Hans and Caitlin. I am very excited to be a new member of the Blockpass team! </span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think the biggest benefit of blockchain is decentralization, as blockchain will use this to eliminate the risks of data breaches, hacking and other bad practices. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain and KYC are still most associated with ICOs, but in near future I believe the technology will go mainstream to meet the needs of data security and transparency. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would love to spend an hour talking to Stephen Hawking. I have always been a fan of space and time travelling. It would be great if I could discuss these kinds of topics with him and learn from him.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
