The application is used to onboard users to crypto and hybrid trading platforms, including <a href=\"https://wavesplatform.com/\">Waves</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ethfinex.com/\">Ethfinex</a>, or <a href=\"https://legacytrust.com.hk/en/\">Legacy Trust</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To create a digital profile (also referred to as a unique access key), the user is required to </span><span class=\"s1\">provide their personal data, which can now be acquired automatically and instantly by its extraction from the identity document. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"We are constantly looking for ways to improve the usability of the Blockpass App,\" said Blockpass CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaziri/\">Adam Vaziri</a>. \"With the addition of <a href=\"https://smartengines.com/\">Smart Engines</a>, verifying your identity has never been easier. This great tool allows for seamless addition of identity documents reducing the friction and complexity of completing your KYC.\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The transition to Web 3.0 format, as well as the shift to the omniconnection mode, imposes\_</span><span class=\"s1\">special requirements on the systems that automate the personal data input in terms of how </span><span class=\"s1\">that data is being stored and processed. Smart Engines technologies allow to reduce the </span><span class=\"s1\">risks associated with data leakage to a minimum, as well as the time required to create an </span><span class=\"s1\">online profile.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About Blockpass IDN</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass offers digital identity verification for businesses that participate in regulated industries, including crypto wallets and exchanges, virtual banks, traditional financial institutions and gaming.
