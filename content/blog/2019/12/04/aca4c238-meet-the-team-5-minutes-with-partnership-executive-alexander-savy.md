    - "<strong>Where are you from and what is your work background?</strong>\r\nI come from a financial industry background, with 10+ years experience in insurance, payments and the blockchain industry.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is your role at Blockpass?</strong>\r\nI assist big companies in understanding the value of the Blockpass products and help them to comply with current AML regulations and KYC requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>What do your daily activities look like?</strong>\r\nMy day can be broadly split into three main areas:\r\n1) Discussing with customers on the potential threats of not performing full client verification.\r\n2) Discussing current AML and KYC requirements from regulators.\r\n3) Explaining the automatisation of client verifications and how much simpler the process is with Blockpass’ solutions.\r\n\r\n<strong>How did you get involved in Blockpass?</strong>\r\nI met Adam and Hans at one of the blockchain conferences in London, where I was representing another blockchain company. Since then I began following the updates of the company and recently decided that now is the right moment to join the KYC and AML revolution!\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?</strong>\r\nTransparency.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?</strong>\r\nI think blockchain is going to see massive adoption.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?</strong>\r\nHenry Ford, to talk with him about how he changed the whole industry, and what his main motivation was."
