text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past 3 years, I played an important role in the HR and Operations department within a new startup FinTech company in Hong Kong. During these 3 years, working in an intensive and fast-paced environment, I gained many experiences, from participating in recruitment activities, company restructuring, manpower planning, and office relocation projects with the assistance of the CEO.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Blockpass, I work as an HR specialist for handling all HR-related matters. In the meantime, I also contribute to administration and operations experiences to support the administrative duties, and the finance team for the general office operations.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gives me lots of opportunities for growth and advancement. My duties test and prove my competency for challenging jobs in the high-technology market.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became a member of Blockpass only very recently after applying for the role.\_ I’m very excited to work closely with everyone at Blockpass.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favourite blockchain benefits are the greater transparency in transactions, and enhanced security for any kind of services that it provides.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I truly believe that blockchain has the potential to make every centralized process, activity, and organization fully autonomous. This means we can eliminate intermediaries, authorities, and churn. There’s no doubt about blockchain has legitimate potential to change the world.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I could spend an hour with Yuri Gagarin. I would like to ask about his feelings on becoming the first person to orbit the Earth, and the first human in space.</span>"
