text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have already created a Blockpass identity, simply head over to the </span><a href=\"https://tokinex.ethfinex.com/token-sale/5ce5b0ff0a6ddd82b38f8e0c/Ampleforth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokinex website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and log into your account; select the Ultra IEO, and click Verify. Be sure to verify using your Blockpass identity well in advance of the kick-off so that you are registered with plenty of time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using your Blockpass App, scan the QR code and submit the relevant identity documentation. It’s that easy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass has long been partnered with Ethfinex, the parent company of the Tokinex platform, and has provided KYC and AML verification for previous successful IEOs hosted by the company, including Dusk and Ampleforth. Using the Blockpass App, customers can easily create a pre-verified digital identity which can then be used to sign up to the Tokinex platform with one-click submission on registration. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultra is a protocol and platform positioned to disrupt the $140bn USD gaming industry using blockchain technology to allow anyone to build and operate their own game distribution platform or virtual goods trading service. In doing so, it challenges the current monopoly held by industry heavyweights Steam, Google, and Apple. This will unlock new opportunities and create value for all the actors involved. Large commercial partnerships are signed, the protocol and platform have been built and will be launched in open beta in October 2019. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information about the Ultra protocol, </span><a href=\"https://ultra.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">click here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our partnership with Ethfinex has been extremely successful so far, and it’s been great to see the Blockpass App coming to life which such versatile utility.” Said Blockpass CEO, Adam Vaziri. “Customers who have created a Blockpass identity and passed eKYC checks for previous IEOs within the Tokinex platform can simply scan the QR code for the Ultra IEO and click submit. This integration is really working to simplify the process for Ultra, Tokinex and the consumer alike, and it’s fantastic to see it all interact so seamlessly.”\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"After the successful Ampleforth sale two weeks ago, we are delighted to welcome Ultra to Tokinex. Blockpass gives our users a quick and easy way of managing their personal KYC data, whilst at the same time allowing us to manage the approval process for different token sales and token issuers in a secure and compliant manner.” - JL van der Velde, Bitfinex &amp; Ethfinex CEO </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
