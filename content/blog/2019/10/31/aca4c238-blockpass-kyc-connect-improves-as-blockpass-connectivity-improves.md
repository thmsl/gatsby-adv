The various options provided cover identity creation, document authentication, AML &amp; PEP Screening, selfie matching verification, proof of address verification, AML check false-positive analysis, risk profiling and customised Service Level Agreements (SLA). This means that potential partners can choose a solution to suit them. In doing this, Blockpass encourages all manner of industries and services to use our solutions, and thanks to this we have already been able to partner with many amazing and innovative companies.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue to bring on a multitude of new partners to the Blockpass platform, one of our prime goals remains to make it as quick and easy for businesses to integrate Blockpass and to begin onboarding new customers as seamlessly as possible.
