text: "<b>Where are you from and what is your work background?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have over 2 years experience of Admin/Receptionist with a history of working in the consumer goods industry. My work has involved a lot of communications, event management, and administration. I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology where I studied Foreign Linguistic focused in Business English - Tourism .</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\_</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your role at Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Blockpass, I work as an Office Admin &amp; HR Assistant, I report to Cynthia and will support Thomas and Toan.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What do your daily activities look like?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am working in the Vietnam office where my duties include updating, organising and maintaining filing systems, handling daily office admin duties, travel arrangements, and support for management and senior staff with administrative tasks.\_</span>\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved in Blockpass?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, I worked for IBL (Infinity Blockchain Labs) in an Admin/Receptionist role. Within IBL, there are many smaller teams with their own expertise and projects. Blockpass has a team among them, hence I got the chance to get to know Blockpass</span>\r\n\r\n<b>What’s your favourite blockchain related benefit?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since I am not a technology expert and blockchain is a fairly new technology, I cannot go in details as to my personal favorite blockchain related benefits. However, from my current knowledge, I am excited to know that blockchain technology helps create a transparent environment for every stakeholder involved in the system, as well as privilege and security that can be spread amongst all the users.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see the industry headed over the next 5 years?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that with the rapid development of technology, within the next 5 years, blockchain will not only become the standard of data integration in business operations, but it will also connect and be further integrated and implemented with other technologies such as Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data, to improve the quality of life and efficiency for any business or corporation.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone from history, who would it be and why?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I could spend an hour with anyone from history, I would like to meet with either Leonardo Da Vinci or Nikola Tesla. The reason is that they were extraordinary people in their own time, with ideas and inventions that proved so important over time. If I could meet them, I would love to hear their opinions and their expectations for the future compared to the reality of 2019. I would tell them of the technology we now have and how the world has changed up to the year of 2019. Last but not least, knowing the current reality of 2019, it would be interesting to hear their predictions for the year 2050.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
