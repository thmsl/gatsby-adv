text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headquartered in Hong Kong, Blockpass is a leading <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/regtech/\">RegTech</a> and Compliance business which provides digital identity verification as a service. Through its vast network of partners, Blockpass is creating an ecosystem of pre-verified customers for easy and seamless customer onboarding for any regulated business and industry. Blockpass aims to provide a solution which puts the user back in control of their data and is working with the <a href=\"https://identity-lab.blockpass.org/\">Blockpass Identity Lab</a> in Edinburgh Napier University to develop technology such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption that could eventually see the need for users to show their personal details eliminated.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://beam.mw/\">Beam</a> is a blockchain and cryptocurrency developed using the Mimblewimble protocol to create a scalable and flexible solution which puts privacy first - with no information about transaction participants being stored on-chain. The platform’s “Scriptless Script” technology enables a range of transaction types to take place, including escrow and atomic swapping. Beam’s vision is building a cryptocurrency that combines complete confidentiality with opt-in compliance, allowing both business and personal uses of the currency without compromising the privacy in any way.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we were creating Blockpass we knew that the privacy-centric goal of cryptocurrencies and blockchain - putting control back in the hands of the user - was the future. At the same time, we realized the importance of regulatory compliance. This is what drove the development of a user-centric, user-controlled Blockpass identity we believe will underpin every aspect of interaction with the blockchain ecosystem.” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaziri/?originalSubdomain=hk\">Adam Vaziri</a>, CEO of Blockpass. “As a company whose ideals match our own so closely, we are excited to work with Beam to enable a safe, secure and confidential space for users to transact and interact, and to develop new and innovative use cases for this collaboration.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander Zaidelson, CEO of Beam: “At Beam, we want to give users full sovereignty over their funds and over their information. That means that users should be able to decide for themselves whether they stay completely confidential or disclose their information to designated 3rd parties. Wallet KYC may be a desirable feature for business users, and we are glad to partner with Blockpass on this. ”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockpass continues to work on expanding its uses and features, with multiple partnerships announced this year, including Waves, Tokenomica, the BBFTA and Ethfinex. There have been a number of updates to the app, with the most significant seeing the release of Face Match Certification. The partnership between Blockpass and Edinburgh Napier recently saw its six month anniversary and the work being carried out at the Blockpass Identity Lab will see improved privacy for the user as solutions are developed. The Blockpass App is available to download from the </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blockpass/id1322917010\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App Store</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockpass_mobile\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Play</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\r\n\r\n<b>About Blockpass IDN</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of Blockpass IDN (</span><a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.blockpass.org/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) is the global realization of identity for the Internet of Everything. Through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, Blockpass is a production-ready Regtech platform offering shared regulatory and compliance services for humans, businesses, objects and devices. As this identity system supports verification of humans (KYC), objects (KYO) and connected devices (KYD), it will enable the development of new applications that rely on a trusted connection between human, corporate, and device identities.
