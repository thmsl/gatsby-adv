    - "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass has long been partnered with Ethfinex, the parent company of the <a href=\"https://tokensales.bitfinex.com/token-sales\">Tokinex</a> platform, and has provided <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a> and AML verification for previous successful ICOs hosted by the company. Through the Blockpass App, customers can easily sign up to the Tokinex platform with the one-click submission of their pre-verified identity. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal of the Ampleforth IEO is to build </span><span class=\"s2\">a digital-asset protocol for </span><span class=\"s1\">smart commodity money</span><span class=\"s2\">, </span><span class=\"s1\">with a unique elastic supply. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to its price deviating from a 1 USD target. The Ampleforth IEO will run from Thursday 13 June through to midnight Wednesday 19 June, with a goal of raising 4.9 million USD.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/06/14/what-is-an-initial-exchange-offering/\">Initial Exchange Offering</a> platform Tokinex was unveiled by parent companies Bitfinex and Ethfinex in May 2019. Tokinex allows users to discover, as well as participate in, curated, pre-vetted token sales from new and exciting projects in the crypto space, directly from their Finex accounts. The new platform has been built with the user experience in mind and has undergone significant testing, ensuring that the contribution process is easy and reliable. With a carefully designed user experience, Tokinex makes participating in token sales an easy and exciting process.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“The beauty of using the Blockpass App for identity verification during the customer onboarding process is how quick and easy it really is.” Said Blockpass CEO, Adam Vaziri. “For customers who already have a Blockpass identity, they simply scan the QR code and click submit, and the company receives all their documents, pre-vetted and ready to go.This IEO is a perfect use case for our platform, taking the pain out of signing up to this great new service, Tokinex.” </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“Tokinex is proud to partner with Blockpass, this demonstrates both platform’s commitments to data privacy and user experience. Blockpass is leading the way in data sovereign verification and we are delighted to deliver this solution to the IEO space,” said Henry Child, Commercial Strategy at Tokinex and Ethfinex.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass continues to work on expanding its uses and features, with multiple partnerships announced this year, including Waves, Tokenomica, the BBFTA and Ethfinex. There have been a number of updates to the app, with the most significant seeing the release of Face Match Certification.\_</span></p>\r\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Xxbxtc\"><img class=\" wp-image-3321 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.blockpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/RegisterNow-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"62\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About Blockpass IDN</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal of Blockpass IDN (<a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/\"><span class=\"s3\">http://www.blockpass.org/</span></a>) is the global realization of identity for the Internet of Everything.
