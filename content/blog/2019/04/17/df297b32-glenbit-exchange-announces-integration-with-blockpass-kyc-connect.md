text: "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GlenBit is a blockchain assets exchange platform<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\_ </span>headquartered in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Its technical and operational teams are spread over Europe and Asia Pacific region, with offices based in Tokyo, Beijing, Zhengzhou and Shenzhen.The birth of <a href=\"https://www.glenbit.com/\">GlenBit</a> is the convergence of advances in traditional commerce, financial technology and artificial intelligence.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass is a leading RegTech and Compliance business which provides digital identity verification as a service. Through its vast network of partners, Blockpass is creating an ecosystem of pre-verified customers for easy and seamless customer onboarding for any regulated business and industry. After recently launching its <a href=\"http://blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC Connect</a> service, Blockpass has already announced integrations with <a href=\"https://www.ethfinex.com/\">Ethfinex</a>, ethecal, <a href=\"https://bbfta.org/\">BBFTA</a>, <a href=\"https://tokenomica.com/\">Tokenomica</a>, <a href=\"https://legacytrust.com.hk/en/\">Legacy Trust,</a> <a href=\"https://corporateoptions.co.im/\">Corporate Options</a> and a number of others. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“By integrating KYC Connect Plus into our onboarding process, we can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for customers to sign up to our platform, while knowing that we are still meeting global regulatory requirements for compliant verification,” said Mr WenFei Xu, Operations Manager of GlenBit.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“The great thing about Blockpass, is the more merchants and exchanges that come on board, the greater the ecosystem of verified profiles that become available,” said Adam Vaziri, CEO of Blockpass. “Adding a global exchange like GlenBit to our roster of partners means that we can continue to expand our user-base and continue to pass on the savings from multi-use verification.”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Blockpass KYC Connect provides low cost pre-verified compliance with shared regulatory and compliance services so merchants can onboard users without the expensive and duplicative identity verification process for the same user multiple times across different services. With a verified Blockpass digital identity, customers can simply scan a QR code and easily send verified profiles to merchants, reducing the time and the friction of onboarding. </span></p>"
