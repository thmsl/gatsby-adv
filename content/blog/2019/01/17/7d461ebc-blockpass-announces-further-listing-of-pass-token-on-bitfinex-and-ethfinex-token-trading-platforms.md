text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/token/\">PASS</a> is an ERC20 <a href=\"http://www.blockpass.org/kyc\">KYC</a> standard utility token that serves as a discount voucher for the Blockpass platform. The first-of-its kind, PASS seamlessly integrates KYC-compliant identities into the token, ensuring that all holders are fully verified before they are able to transfer it on.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.bitfinex.com/\">Bitfinex</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ethfinex.com/\">Ethfinex</a> seek to provide quick and direct access to high-quality ERC20 crowdsales, whilst providing an information and discussion platform for users in order to allow them to optimise their trading experience. As a spin-off of Bitfinex, Ethfinex makes use of Bitfinex’s trading engine and customer experience expertise to deliver the most highly liquid and advanced trading platform available for ERC20 tokens and crowdsales.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These listings are the result of a lot of hard work from both Blockpass and the teams at Bitfinex and Ethfinex.” said Blockpass CEO, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaziri/\">Adam Vaziri</a>. “The revolutionary nature of the PASS Token as a KYC token means that we are not only developing new technology for token listing, but also laying the groundwork for a regulated future, which is the going to become the gold standard of the industry. As <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/2019/05/25/what-is-a-security-token-and-a-security-token-offering/\">Security Token Offerings</a> and the digitisation of assets continue to become more prevalent, we will be ready to meet the market needs through our pioneering PASS token.” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Bitfinex and Ethfinex, PASS Tokens can also be found on HitBTC, Lykke, GateCoin and Cryptopia. Blockpass has worked tirelessly to cement its status as an industry leader in the compliance and <a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/regtech/\">regtech</a> space, with the development of the world’s premier security token enabled wallet, Infinito Wallet. Blockpass has announced a number of key partnerships in recent months, most notably the establishment of a world-first advanced blockchain identity research laboratory, the <a href=\"https://identity-lab.blockpass.org/\">Blockpass Identity Lab</a>, in collaboration with Edinburgh Napier University. </span>"
