text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all of the talent and expertise in the room, it may have been hard to pick out the best parts of the seminar, but Matthew Dove, Senior Editor at the Fintech Times, published two articles on the event shortly afterwards, highlighting two of the speakers in particular. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first article to come out focused on the keynote speech given by Lord Holmes, advocating the benefits of security tokens and blockchain technology whilst also talking about some of the obstacles. Dove opened his article covering Lord Holmes’ address with: </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For well over a year now we’ve been told that the smouldering ashes of the initial coin offering craze would yield a tokenised phoenix; the much-vaunted but little seen STO (security token offering).

Dove wrote:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At its security token seminar in London on April 23, Blockpass’ CEO Adam Vaziri laid out his vision for upcoming blockchain innovation. The future of tokenisation isn’t just about making money without falling foul of regulators. It’s also about the establishment of self-sovereign identity…”</span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://thefintechtimes.com/regtech-compliance-blockpass/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to read the Fintech Times coverage of Adam Vaziri’s speech.</span>"
