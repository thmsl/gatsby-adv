    - "<b>Where are you from and what is your background?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m originally from Ilkley, West Yorkshire. I went to York university to study computer science but I didn't particularly enjoy it; however, the best part was a placement at Lhasa Limited as a software developer where I learnt to code. I decided I wanted to become a software developer and after university I was offered a job at Lhasa which I accepted following a 6 month break for travelling. Part of my travels was for fun as a “digital nomad”, but in Chiang Mai I first came into serious contact with blockchain and got excited about it. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What are you currently working on in the BIL?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The area I'm currently working on is Delegatable Credentials and how they could be applied governance frameworks and how this would fit different industries. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Will keeps a blog where he discuss his work at the BIL which you can find <a href=\"https://misterwip.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What does a ‘typical’ day look like?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t have too many typical days but I like to start early for a couple of hours in my office at home (a box room with no windows) - it’s good for reading papers or writing. I then head into the lab which is good for writing code. I also have a favourite coffee shop to work from called Round Square coffee.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How did you get involved with the BIL?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first got involved with blockchain through attending meetups in Chiang Mai while travelling. After that I was hooked and spent spare time learning. I attended the Internet of Agreements where I heard Vinay Gupta give a talk on the importance of identity. This lead me to focus my efforts on understanding identity as I really believe it is a use case for the technology that could improve people's lives. I saw a tweet about an opportunity to work at the BIL and decided to apply. I quit my job after 8 months without knowing if I was accepted but determined to get involved in identity or blockchain space regardless. Fortunately it all worked out!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What is your favourite blockchain-related benefit?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure really. I like being in a fast moving field with so many experts to talk with and discuss these problems. I feel lucky to be at the forefront of what I see as the next technological revolution. I’m excited to see where it goes.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What are you most excited to work on/develop?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m excited to become a leader in developing cryptography. I want to contribute code to the hyperledger ursa project but there is still a long way to go.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Where do you see blockchain/cryptography industry heading in the next five years?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope in the next 5 years people can truly say they can control their own identity; that they have the tools and are empowered to control their connections, credentials and data - and importantly to do so without requiring any third party input. That is ambitious and there is a long way to go but a lot of smart people are working in this space. I am optimistic. I also hope this tech impacts the global south, rather than just remaining a technology for the western world as that is where it could have the biggest impact.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>If you could spend an hour with anyone in history, who would it be with and why?\r\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a bit random but the Duke of Wellington. I am really interested in that period of history and he was a fascinating figure of the time. I suppose for someone more related to my life I would be interested to talk with Einstein about Quantum Mechanics - an area I have a side interest in.</span>"
