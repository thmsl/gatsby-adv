    - "News of massive data leaks has, unfortunately, become all too commonplace. Just a few weeks after the biggest security breach ever discovered, April turned out to be a catastrophic month for cybersecurity as well. Of the 7 events analysed this month, two breaches both affected greater than 200 million individuals, with approximately 10% of the world's population being affected overall. A common theme between the breaches is data being put on unprotected or unsecured databases without the users’ knowledge. Interestingly, the data in these two breaches dates back quite some time. Hopefully will we see, in a few years, that new data protection regulations like the EU’s GDPR will have made a difference.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since, November the Blockpass team has analysed six months worth of data and found that, statistically, 50% of the world's population has been the victim of a data breach. Extrapolating from this we can predict that over the course of a year most people will be the victim of a hack or leak. Blockpass is working towards a future when these kinds of statistics are eliminated by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">empowering users to be in full of their data and eventually eliminating the need for centralised data stores.</span>\r\n<table style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong># of Events Analyzed</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong># of Identities Lost</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt; 751,000,000</span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong>% of World Population</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\">&gt; 9.9%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\"><strong>Industry Hardest Hit</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;\">Social Media</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\nThis report, for the month of April, is the sixth of our Data Breach Intelligence Reports. We encourage the Blockpass community and anyone who might be otherwise interested to let us know what kinds of information they would like to see provided in future reports by contacting us at marketing@blockpass.org under the subject line “Suggestions for the blog.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Facebook| Social Media | Up to 540,000,000\r\n</strong>According to a report by cybersecurity research firm UpGuard, the personal information of as many as 540 million Facebook users has been available in an unprotected database on Amazon’s cloud computing service. The data appears to have been posted to the server by two third-party Facebook app developers.\r\n\r\nUpGuard has named Mexican media company Cultura Colectiva as the main culprit. The company uploaded around 146 gigabytes of user data that had been collected on Facebook. Exposed data includes users’ names, IDs, comments, and reactions.\r\n\r\nAnother culprit is an app called At the Pool. The app was meant to provide a way to help people meet up for offline activities, although the service ended in 2014. Data leaked from this app includes Facebook user IDs, friends, photos, location check-ins, and some passwords.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://investorplace.com/2019/04/facebook-data-breach-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://investorplace.com/2019/04/facebook-data-breach-2019/</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millions-facebook-user-records-exposed-amazon-cloud-server/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millions-facebook-user-records-exposed-amazon-cloud-server/</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Unknown| Unknown | 202,400,000\r\n</strong>The perpetrators of this month’s second biggest case of data negligence, which was only revealed on the 30th of April, have yet to be revealed. It has been confirmed by Microsoft’s cloud services division that the personal details of 80 million US households had been left on a database they hosted for anyone online to see.\r\n\r\nThe average American household consists of 2.53 individuals. This means that it can be calculated that over 200 million individuals have been affected. The data within the database, including home addresses, full names, marital statuses, income brackets, ages, and birthdates, could be extremely valuable to fraudsters.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:\r\n</span><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/details-on-80-million-us-households-exposed-by-unprotected-cloud-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/details-on-80-million-us-households-exposed-by-unprotected-cloud-database/</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Bodybuilding.com| Health and Fitness | Up to 7,000,000\r\n</strong>Bodybuilding.com, a hugely popular online community and store for bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts, disclosed in mid-April that some percentage of its seven million users may have had their data exposed to hackers following a phishing attack that occurred in February. The attack has been linked to an email that had been opened by a Bodybuilding.com employee.\r\n\r\nWhile the data has certainly been exposed, website staff are unsure whether or not it has in fact been accessed. Exposed data includes names, email addresses, billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers, and order histories. Bodybuilding.com staff have said that they have reset all user passwords.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/bodybuilding-com-discloses-security-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/bodybuilding-com-discloses-security-breach/</a>\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Georgia Tech| University | 1,300,000\r\n</strong>The Georgia Institute of Technology revealed on April 4th that the personal data of as many as 1.3 million current and former students and employees had been leaked. The university has said that the security breach has occurred as a result of vulnerable web application.\r\n\r\nThere is fear that far reaching user data such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of birth may have been exposed. The breach is currently under investigation by the US Department of Education and the University System of Georgia.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/georgia-tech-reveals-data-breach-1-3-million-records-exposed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/georgia-tech-reveals-data-breach-1-3-million-records-exposed/</a>\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Docker Hub| Image Repository | 190,000\r\n</strong>On April 26th, it was reported that the account information of about 190,000 Docker Hub users had been compromised. The Docker Hub is an online repository of Docker application images to run and is a go-to source in the development community. Docker Hub has stated that the breach affected about five percent of its users.\r\n\r\nThe Docker Hub did act quickly on the breach, which was discovered on April 25th. They announced the issue to their community on the following day. Leaked data includes usernames and hashed passwords, as well as GitHub and Bitbucket tokens which can be used for Docker autobuilds.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.eweek.com/security/docker-hub-breached-impacting-190-000-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.eweek.com/security/docker-hub-breached-impacting-190-000-accounts</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>University of Alaska| University | Tens of thousands\r\n</strong>On the 28th of April, administrators at the University of Alaska (UA) announced in a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/university-of-alaska---notice-of-data-breach-300839171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press\_ release</a> that some student records had been leaked through compromised email login names and passwords. The exact number of accounts that had been breached has not been publicly released, but it can be presumed to be in the tens of thousands given the university’s size.\r\n\r\nThe university began finding traces of unauthorized access to UAOnline reports as early as February 2018. Following an investigation that was carried out in March 2018, the university determined that student accounts had been accessed between January and February of that year. The university <a href=\"https://mustreadalaska.com/university-warning-of-data-breach-year-later/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has not seen the need</a> to warn of the breach until now, more than one year later.\r\n\r\nLeaked data varies depending on the type of information stored on the account; however, in extreme cases students may have seen leaked their names, government issued identification numbers (in many cases social security numbers), dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, health and health insurance information, passport numbers, and UA student ID numbers\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/university-of-alaska---notice-of-data-breach-300839171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/university-of-alaska---notice-of-data-breach-300839171.html</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://mustreadalaska.com/university-warning-of-data-breach-year-later/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mustreadalaska.com/university-warning-of-data-breach-year-later/</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Microsoft| Communications | Undisclosed\r\n</strong>Only months after January’s big reveal that 773 million Microsoft email addresses, and tens of millions of addresses, had been exposed to the public, Microsoft informed users early April that a “limited” number of additional addresses had been leaked between January 1st and March 28th of this year.\r\n\r\nAs reported by Techcrunch, any user of an @hotmail.com or @msn.com could be at risk of having had some of the personal information leaked. Microsoft says that they have closed up the vulnerability, but that for a certain amount of time hackers were able to see affected users’ email addresses, folder names, subject lines and contact email addresses. No email contents or login details seem to have been affected.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\n<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/13/microsoft-support-agent-email-hack/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/13/microsoft-support-agent-email-hack/</a>"
