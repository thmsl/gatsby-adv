text: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing is, you’re actually in a very privileged position here. In fact,</span><a href=\"http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/21571460567481655/April-2016-ID4D-Strategic-RoadmapID4D.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> more than one billion people alive today have no valid government-issued identity</em></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An entire one-seventh of the world population cannot prove their identities to service providers - and this has sweeping implications. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article goes over just a few of them.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Limited access to healthcare</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don’t often think about it, but our identities are absolutely essential to our medical care. In some ways, too, our medical care is essential to the establishment of our identities. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The very first medical care we receive, of course, is at our birth. A record of this - our birth certificate - lays the foundation for our identity. One of the major contributors to the massive amount of people without provable identities, however, is the fact that fifty percent of low- to mid-income countries have inadequate birth registration systems. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is problematic because it leaves millions of children in anonymity until they hopefully get entered into the system at some future date. In the meantime, infant mortality rates increase, since any early health issues go unrecorded. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue relating to identity in healthcare pertains to vaccination histories. For many vaccines - such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine - three doses are required. In these cases, records must exist in order to contact patients who <a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">require their second or third dose</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Financial Exclusion</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial services are nearly universally regulated, requiring the customer to be able to prove who they are. In situations where people have no access to identity documents, financial exclusion is nearly always a given.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, without identity documents, it is simply not feasible to open a bank account. According to the World Bank - owing to a number of factors, including identification - <a href=\"https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">31% of adults worldwide were unbanked as of 2017</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a problem, of course, because it greatly stifles upward mobility. In countries that are still industrializing or developing, one of the key ways that people can improve their lives is by saving until they have enough capital to purchase a home, access education, or start a business. This becomes exceedingly difficult when those people have no ability to keep their money safe.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from general banking, microloans, which have been shown to be highly effective in stimulating economic prosperity at a grassroots level in developing countries, are not possible without provable identities. Lenders want to be able to know they can track down their investments, while regulators know that lending environments are not sustainable without knowing the identities of borrowers.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Political Exclusion</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not uncommon for political parties to use citizens’ inability to obtain identity documents to their advantage and in many countries it is a legal requirement that a passport or ID be presented at the voting booth.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in many developed countries where the majority of people have identity documents - such as in the United States, certain vulnerable communities do not have adequate identification. This can leave millions of people disenfranchised and can result in radically undemocratic election results.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>What can be done?</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, a lot of progress is actually being made.
