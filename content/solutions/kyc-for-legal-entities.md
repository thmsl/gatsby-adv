  ## Legal entities are created to enable contracts to be drawn up, lawsuits to
  be carried out, regulations to be ascribed, and many other vital aspects of
  business and commerce to be carried out with different entities.


  The necessity of know your customer (KYC) and identity management for legal entities is obvious. It is imperative to verify their clients’ identity and credentials, a legal entity would not be able to interact with others, negating the entire reason for their existence.

  ## In a digital world, legal entities need to be able to prove who they are
  and who is behind them in order for any contract or deal or other interaction
  to take place without the very real risk of fraud.


  People can hide behind the public face of the company to get around restrictions or obligations they would otherwise have to comply with.Collusion, misrepresentation, identity theft, breach of contract, fraudulent trading and a vast array of cyber-crimes are all possible without methods of verifying identity.
text4: Traditionally, these methods of identification required meetings
  in-person to sign physical documents. This later evolved to incorporate
  digital contracts and documents to allow for a digital record. Today, there is
  a growing movement to remove the requirement for face-to-face meetings to
  prove identities or credentials, and to instead move to a model to allow for
  all types of interactions between legal entities to be carried out entirely
  online. However, in order for this to be enabled, a safe, secure, efficient
  and easy-to-use solution needs to be implemented to allow for those that are
  conducting business to be sure they are avoiding the dangers of fraud when
  working in the digital world.

text5: Any time a company is established or wishes to sign a contract or work
  officially with another company, there is a legal requirement for some form of
  KYC or identity verification to take place to ensure that business is being
  conducted in accordance with the regulations and guidelines set by the
  jurisdiction it is tied to. Documentation provision can involve a vast array
  of certificates or other official documents, such as Certificates of
  Incumbency, Memorandum and Articles of association, Bylaws, Certificates of
  Good Standing, Certificates of Registered address, Certificates of Directors
  and Secretary, Register of Directors, Power of Attorney, Financial Statements,
  Joint Venture Agreements and any manner of other evidence or paperwork
  required for specific cases.
