  ## Know your customer (KYC) is in high demand in the financial industry.


  **Financial institutions are required by regulatory organizations to conduct [KYC](https://www.blockpass.org/kyc/) procedures across the world before onboarding customers to prevent fraud, money laundering activities and financing of terrorism. KYC helps financial institutions to be compliant and enhance their credibility in the eyes of customers.**


  [KYC](https://www.blockpass.org/kyc/) and [AML](https://www.blockpass.org/aml/) for financial services include risk assessments, due diligence and transaction analysis to avoid fraud. There are different levels of [Anti-Money Laundering (AML)](https://www.blockpass.org/aml/) and anti-fraud measures:

  authenticates and verifies client’s identities by the financial institution
  before onboarding the customer. Simple information to be collected includes:
  name, phone number, identity documents, proof of address etc."

text2: "CDD – Customer Due Diligence: financial institutions are held
  accountable for whether their customers are compliant with [AML
  standards](https://www.blockpass.org/aml/) and need to conduct risk
  assessments of customers with the provided information. Financial institutions
  are also required to monitor accounts, detect and report potential financial
  crimes, on a continuous basis."

  high-risk customers includes [ongoing
  AML](https://www.blockpass.org/2019/10/21/ongoing-aml-provision-comes-to-bloc\
  kpass/) monitoring of and countries’ and individuals’ sanctions and
  Politically Exposed Person (PEP) lists, as well as screening of Adverse Media.
  The due diligence process should be guided by information provided
  by [AML](https://www.blockpass.org/aml/) regulators in the company’s
  jurisdiction."

  ## KYC Legislative Landscape


  **[KYC](https://www.blockpass.org/kyc/) law is an increasingly complex issue for the financial industry. Financial institutions have to adhere to both international and local anti-money laundering regulations. Here are some of the policies in place in the EU and USA, two of the top three economies in size.**
text4: "**Europe:** The European Union (EU) adopted the first anti-money
  laundering Directive in 1990 in order to prevent the misuse of the financial
  system for the purpose of money laundering. It indicates financial
  institutions are obliged to apply customer due diligence during onboarding
  procedures. It has been constantly revised in order to mitigate risks relating
  to money laundering and terrorist financing. In 2015, the EU adopted a
  modernised regulatory framework – the 5th Anti-Money Laundering
  Directive. [More

text5: "**US:** The US [AML](https://www.blockpass.org/aml/) laws and
  regulations started with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) that requires financial
  institutions to assist the US government to detect, monitor and investigate
  any potential money laundering activities by identifying suspicious
  transactions. The USA Patriot Act was passed into law soon after the September
  2011 terrorist attacks which amended the BSA and required financial
  institutions to maintain more formal AML programmes. The Act also prohibited
  financial institutions from engaging in business with foreign shell banks and
  increased civil and criminal penalties for money laundering. [More

  **FATF:** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to develop
  policies among the G7 countries to counter global money laundering and
  terrorist financing. It is an inter-governmental body of 39 economically
  leading countries that sets international standards adopted by most countries
  and jurisdictions to fight financing for organized crime, corruption and
  terrorism. [More info.](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/)
