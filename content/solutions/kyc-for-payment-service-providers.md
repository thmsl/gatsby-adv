  ## With the upward trend of the online/ remote businesses, payment service
  providers (PSPs) have played a more important role to process online payments.


  PSPs process many transactions everyday, and it’s required for PSPs to ensure legitimacy of parties involved in transactions, hence a proper merchant onboarding processes have to be in place to protect businesses/ individuals using any PSPs from frauds or any money-laundering and illegal activities.

  ## Application of KYC


  PSPs are responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of companies using their services and will not harm any party’s financial conditions or reputation.  PSPs have the right to reject providing services to any suspicious business entities. KYC is usually included in the merchant onboarding process of PSPs. Each PSP establishes different KYC policies. During most of the KYC procedures, PSPs will verify certain information of the business/ individual.  


  * Company Registration & Beneficiary Documents - documentation issued by relevant jurisdictions, shareholder registration and statement on the actual beneficiaries, individual KYC and certified proofs of identity of real beneficiaries and directors (document proofs of their identities, address, organizational structure etc.)

  * Terms of Conditions - Online point of sale contract signed by your customers

  * Business Plan - For a start up company with no commercial history, business plan will be required.

  * Bank Account Details - Details of the bank accounts that will process transactions using PSPs


  PSPs should audit the whole paying processes of its merchants to ensure fast and safe client experience with clear terms and conditions.
