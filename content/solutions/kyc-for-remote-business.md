  ## Traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are known for face-to-face
  interaction. However, things have changed with the pandemic striking the world
  at the end of 2019.


  It is finally acceptable to perform KYC through remote measures with the use of technologies, including biometrics, video conferencing, blockchain, [OCR](https://www.blockpass.org/2019/02/28/three-technologies-democratizing-identity/) etc.
text1: The trend is also strengthened by the high penetration of mobile devices
  of users, which allows them to perform various tasks to
  satisfy [KYC](http://www.blockpass.org/kyc) and [anti-money laundering
  (AML)](https://www.blockpass.org/2020/11/05/guide-to-global-aml-regulations-2020/) requirements
  remotely without visiting a branch.

text2: As we know, there is already an abundance of software services and apps
  that has made this possible right now. The difficulty is that there is still a
  need to establish trust in order to remotely conclude deals, sign contracts,
  complete applications, and pay individuals. This requires a secure identity
  verification process which is accessible to the public.

text3: Indeed, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the key intergovernmental
  organization developing global policies for combating money laundering and
  terrorist financing, released a [statement on 1 April
  2020](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/statement-covid-19.html),
  addressing in part the “world facing confinement or strict social distancing
  measures” resulting from
  the [COVID-19](https://www.blockpass.org/2020/06/14/cryptography-for-covid-19-how-privacy-can-be-enabled-for-pandemic-contact-tracing/) pandemic.
  The FATF highlighted the need for fintech and regtech that ensures
  “trustworthy digital identity for improving the security, privacy and
  convenience of identifying people remotely for both onboarding and conducting
  transactions” while also mitigating money laundering and terrorist financing
  risks.

  ## For fully remote KYC checking, such remote solutions provide the utmost
  convenience to the users, by eliminating visits to the branches, face-to-face
  meetings and avoiding human errors made during processes.


  Users simply go through the onboarding [KYC](http://www.blockpass.org/kyc) process through a computer / mobile device. Depending on the jurisdictions, users can complete the whole process remotely. Technologies allow users to:

  Direct video transfer or direct photo transfer of an ID document and facial image

  recognition to prove users are who they say they are

  API integration scans users’ identity for AML requirements at instance

  This is precisely the approach Blockpass has taken in our KYC
  Connect solution. Anyone can download the Blockpass Mobile App or use
  Blockpass WebID and create their own identity profile before having it
  verified, completely free of charge. This means that a user can have their KYC
  ready to go when they want to onboard with a merchant at the click of a button
  – useful in saving time in every situation but particularly in time-sensitive
  opportunities. 


  With the huge efficiencies that Blockpass’ approach creates, KYC services can be offered to merchants at a fraction of the cost that they would have expected to pay with face-to-face methods. In addition to this, merchants also don’t have to wait for the KYC process to be completed either – if a user has a verified identity already, they are ready to onboard straight away! Finally, an important benefit of this model and reusable and remote KYC is that the user is in charge of their own personal information and data. They chose which merchants to onboard with and can decide based on the information required – giving them back control of what is their own data, rather than handing over control of it to a company.
